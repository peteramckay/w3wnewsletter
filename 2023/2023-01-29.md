*"800 Pounds of Connectivity" by Peter A. McKay × DALL·E*

**The headlines have been mostly dismal lately** for tech's 800-pound gorillas:

- **Google** is [laying off staff](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/21/google-employees-scramble-for-answers-after-layoffs-hit-long-tenured.html) and [fighting a new antitrust suit](https://www.cnet.com/tech/feds-vs-google-what-dojs-antitrust-lawsuit-means-for-online-ads/) from U.S. regulators over its advertising practices.

- **Meta is facing formidable new competition** from Apple, which plans to [launch a headset](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/apples-arvr-headset-what-to-expect-in-2023/ar-BB14pstE) for metaverse apps. But this might also prove to be a problem for Apple, considering how [disastrously](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/10/what-name-meta-platforms-stock-down-since-change/) the "pivot" to a metaverse strategy has gone for Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Maybe Apple has discovered something Meta hasn't, or maybe this just isn't a product with mass appeal.

- **An anti-hate group** filed a [lawsuit against Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/elon-musk-twitter-antisemitic-hate-speech-lawsuit-germany) in Germany for lax policing of antisemitic content, including holocaust denial.

- **Microsoft was a rare positive**, announcing [decent earnings](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/microsoft-earnings-beat-expectations-cloud-growth-continues-to-slow/ar-AA16Hsp0) and a [$10 billion investment](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html) in OpenAI. However, it has also [announced layoffs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/23/what-microsofts-recent-layoffs-mean-for-the-company-and-investors/) and suffered during the longer tech bear market, down 20% in the past 12 months.

- **Amazon is still implementing** its previously announced [layoff of 18,000 workers](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-to-lay-off-more-than-17-000-workers-more-that-originally-expected-11672875239?mod=hp_minor_pos27).

- **Big Tech has lead the broader decline in stocks.** The Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the largest U.S. tech companies, is down 19% in the past 12 months, compared to a 10% decline in the S&P 500.  

**Why this matters:** If you're keen for decentralized tech becoming mainstream, these developments represent opportunity. Frankly, Big Tech dominates the average user's daily experience of the internet and computing in general. But if such companies are being cut down to size, either by market forces or regulators, it could create openings for other platforms and companies to emerge.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Bitcoin is on pace** for its best January since 2013, up about 40% so far, according to [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/27/bitcoins-best-start-since-2020-led-by-bullish-us-trading-hours/).

Companies in the industry are increasingly [trying to re-brand](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2023/01/20/bad-vibes-from-the-word-crypto-have-some-calling-for-a-rebrand/) away from it, due to negative connotations from the bear market, he said.
