**Bitcoin gave a ray of hope** to investors even as fallout from Crypto Winter continued to be starkly evident in most of the week's other big developments.

BTC saw a frenzied rally that [accelerated](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-spikes-above-21000-is-the-crypto-bear-market-over/ar-AA16lxfZ) late in the week. BTC leapt to a two-month high above $21,000 yesterday, up 23% for the week.

Both crypto and [the stock market](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-subdued-focus-shifts-results-big-us-banks-2023-01-13/) were helped by favorable data on U.S. inflation and consumer sentiment.

Following bitcoin's strong performance, the global crypto market's valuation hovered just shy of $1 trillion in recent trading. And on-chain data shows the average bitcoin purchase over the last five months is now [showing a profit](https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1613628847567831040), according to the research firm Glassnode.

Of course, talking about token prices is one thing. The fortunes of companies that have built businesses atop bitcoin or other open-source crypto projects is a whole other matter.

The week's other notable headlines loudly attest to this distinction:

- **The Winklevoss brothers' Gemini Trust** terminated its partnership with Genesis Global Trading and [escalated criticism](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/gemini-s-winklevoss-demands-removal-of-dcg-ceo-barry-silbert/ar-AA16aNky) of company founder Barry Silbert. Gemini [accused](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/geminis-winklevoss-accuses-crypto-mogul-silbert-of-bad-faith-stalling-tactics-over-frozen-funds/ar-AA15UUqx) Silbert of "bad faith stalling tactics" in returning almost $1 billion in customer funds it lent to his company. Meanwhile, federal regulators [filed a civil complaint](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-7.pdf) against both sides of the industry feud alleging they jointly offered unregistered securities to investors.

- **Exchange layoffs:** [Coinbase](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/coinbase-cuts-nearly-1-000-jobs-citing-rough-crypto-climate/ar-AA16aDBf?OCID=ansmsnnews11) and [Crypto.com](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/13/cryptocom-cuts-workforce-by-nearly-20/) each announced they will lay off an additional 20% of their employees, citing pressures of the longer-term downturn in crypto.

- **FTX's attorney** said the bankrupt exchange has [recovered over $5 billion in assets](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/11/ftx-has-recovered-over-5b-in-assets-bankruptcy-attorney-says/) that it may use to reimburse creditors. In its original bankruptcy filing, FTX said it could have up to $10 billion in liabilities, so it is still falling far short of making clients whole, as the lawyers say. But this does seem like a significant start.

- **Binance now "dominates" crypto trading,** and its founder CZ Zhao is the single [most powerful person](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-01-10/how-did-binance-come-to-dominate-crypto-podcast) in the industry following rival FTX's collapse, according to a new episode of Bloomberg's crypto podcast.

- **U.S. prosecutors arrested** hacker Avraham "Avi" Eisenberg in Puerto Rico and [charged him](https://blockworks.co/news/avi-eisenberg-committed-fraud) with fraud in connection with his $110 exploit of the Mango Markets exchange in October. Eisenberg is also being [sued for civil penalties](https://www.theblock.co/post/200255/cftc-files-its-own-case-against-mango-markets-exploiter) by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

- **The Block reports** that "a growing number" of venture capital firms in crypto complain their portfolio projects are [postponing launch](https://www.theblock.co/post/199734/crypto-vc-token-bets-delayed) of their tokens due to fears over pricing, exchange fees, and increased regulation.

- **MIT Technology Review** reports that a national park in Congo has begun [mining bitcoin with hydroelectric power](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/13/1066820/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-mining-congo-virunga-national-park/) to fund protection of its forests and wildlife. 

- **Bloomberg News reports** that Apple is set to [unveil a mixed-reality headset](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-08/when-will-apple-launch-the-reality-pro-mixed-reality-headset-apple-2023-devices-lcnfzkc7), dubbed Reality Pro, at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June after seven years of development.

- **Are we too dumb for aliens to contact?** A new paper suggests that Earth may not have given off enough signs of intelligent life, or that other civilizations may [not be interested in contacting us](https://www.salon.com/2022/12/21/are-we-too-primitive-for-aliens-to-bother-with-us-some-scientists-think-so/) due to a weak "technosignature." Ouch.
