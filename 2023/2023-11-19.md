**The power struggle that erupted Friday at OpenAI** is as [chaotic](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/technology/sam-altman-open-ai.html) as any I have ever seen at any company. To use a word that's become a personal favorite since the pandemic, we will not be able to *unsee* this anytime soon.

However the situation resolves over the next few days, the fact that it happened at all should remain crucial context through which we filter future developmens at OpenAI. The public and the press should treat this company with a much higher degree of skepticism going forward, and demand greater accountability and transparency.

The board and CEO, [whoever they are](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo) when the dust settles, will inevitably make statements putting a happy face on the whole ruckus, because that is what multibillion-dollar companies do. They will spin it as just a big misunderstanding, you see. But now it will all be settled, the employees will be in harmony, and we can all just merrily carry on as before.

Don't buy it.

All this year, we've been told that widespread use of AI will be one of the biggest technological events in humankind's history, with potentially massive benefits but also risks on par with those [of nuclear weapons](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk).

Well, we just got a closer peek at arguably the most influential people leading the charge on AI, including mitigation of those worst-case scenarios. The picture is not pretty, and that is really why this matters so much.

A useful comparison: OpenAI has a valuation over [$80 billion](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/openai-unicorn-valuation-china-zhipu-thrive/) on the private market. If it were an S&P 500 company, that would put it roughly in the weight class of [Schlumberger](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SLB?p=SLB&.tsrc=fin-srch), [CVS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CVS), and [Progressive](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PGR).

But we tend to discuss tech companies in a very different way than we would an oil driller, a drugstore chain, or an auto insurer, don't we? That has to change.

Regarding their products, tech companies are of course very different than the examples from other industries. But regarding *governance*, they truly are not.

Tech companies are subject to exactly the same greed, careerism, and internal backstabbing as in any other business. And that in turn can profoundly affect how their innovations get integrated into real people's lives.

Despite all its programming brilliance, OpenAI clearly has not solved that more banal corporate problem. Beware.

### Week in Review

**As it happens,** I began using a non-OpenAI app earlier in the week to help me curate headlines for the newsletter. Leo, an AI [recently added](https://brave.com/leo-launch/) to regular releases of the Brave web browser, helped do early drafting of the news summary below.  

Overall, I would give Leo high marks so far. And I love that it has built-in privacy protections, which have always been a priority for Brave. To support them, I have now signed up for a subscription to Leo's paid tier. ☺️

Frankly, I found Leo is not very good right now at surfing entire sites to identify potential stories of interest. But if I fed it links of specific articles I had already identified myself, it did a good job of summarizing them in a sentence or two. I then did additional fact checking and edits, just to be safe.

On to the latest news:

- **The five largest stablecoins** have depegged from the U.S. dollar by at least 3% on over 600 occasions so far this year, according to new research by [Moody's Analytics](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/articles/2023/moody_launches_new_digital_asset_monitor_to_track_risk). The report's timing is worrisome, considering investor money has recently begun flowing into stablecoins for the first time in more than a year, according to [TheStreet.com](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/markets/money-is-flowing-into-crypto-stablecoins-for-first-time-since-collapse-of-2022).
