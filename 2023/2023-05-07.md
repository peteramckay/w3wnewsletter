**Argentina's central bank** just banned payment apps from [offering crypto transactions](https://decrypt.co/139068/argentinas-central-bank-clamps-down-on-bitcoin) in that country.

Translated to English, the [bank's announcement](https://bcra.gob.ar/Noticias/proveedores-servicio-pago-no-pueden-operar-criptoactivos.asp) claims the move will "mitigate the risks that operations with these assets could generate for users."

Ah, yes. The users! Of course the ban on crypto payments is for their sake.

This move could not possibly, in any way, have anything whatsoever to do with recent inflation in Argentina, on track to [hit 126%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/argentina-inflation-seen-at-126-4-in-2023-central-bank-poll-shows/ar-AA1aOrFI) this year. That means the same amount of stuff you could buy for 100 Argentine pesos today would cost you 226 pesos to buy a year from now.

Surely, in banning crypto payments, the central bank isn't worried about a certain phenomenon that economists refer to as "competition" for the peso. They're just worried about the financial health of Argentina's citizens, you see.  

Almost a quarter of that population owns some form of digital money, by the way. That's one of the highest proportions of any country in the world and about double the global average, [according to Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cryptoverse-digital-coins-lure-inflation-weary-argentines-and-turks/ar-AA1aEFy7).

Better for these folks to own that trusty old standby, the peso. It's issued by the government, after all! That weird crypto stuff, with nothing backing it, is way too dangerous.
