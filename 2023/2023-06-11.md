# The false dichotomy of "AI versus crypto"
## #Web3Weekly: June 4-10, 2023

**Venture investor Jason Calicanis** set off a small furor Thursday [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1666874821077250048) with this stark recommendation:

"If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI."

Honestly, I understand why Calicanis might say that, in terms of [mindshare](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mindshare.asp) and tech [hype cycles](https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle) in Silicon Valley, where he's based. Everyone there is talking about artificial intelligence, so there's more money to be had if you're fundraising for a startup right now.

OK. Fine. But...

As an assessment of two emerging technologies on their merits, his framing utterly falls apart. And that should also count for something if we're talking about *technology* companies.

At the Epic Web3 Conference on Friday, Polygon's Boris Spremo, neatly captured the real problem with Calicanis's framing. On a panel about attracting developers to web3, Spremo made two key points:

1. **Blockchains are databases, whereas artificial intelligence is logic.** So from a technical standpoint, the Calicanis tweet is really like comparing apples to oranges. However...

2. **Why not combine them?** Using logic to extract some value from a database is a basic aspect of building internet applications. So why can't AI logic and blockchain data be used *together* to build all sorts of products?

Just to give one simple example: I would love to see an AI app that uses on-chain identity -- and therefore gives users better control over the data they create on the platform -- while providing access to awesome AI functionality. ChatGPT doesn't do this, as its identity model is centralized, exactly as in the social and search apps that have suffered so many privacy nightmares.

For all the ink being spilled in the press right now about the exciting new frontiers being opened by AI, this old, very familiar pattern isn't getting nearly enough attention, in my opinion. A web3 solution would fix it.

**On an unrelated note:** I was really glad to be a media partner of the EW3 Conference. The speakers and panels, like the one I mentioned above, were really insightful, with an upbeat tone we sorely need right now. An awesome event overall. ☺️

All the conference content is paywalled right now, for obvious reasons. But I suspect EW3 will post some highlights on [their website](https://www.epicweb3.com/) eventually. So stay tuned. EW3 also has a [subscription-based networking community](https://my.epicweb3.com/catalog) with catalog of their past content, if that's of interest.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **America's Securities and Exchange Commission** sued both [Binance](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101) and [Coinbase](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102) for operating unregistered securities exchanges, in a pair of actions that could have seismic implications for the token market.

- **The SEC actions sent crypto prices sharply lower,** with speculative altcoins leading the way. Cardano, Solana, and Polygon posted seven-day declines of nearly 30% each in recent trading, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). All three were specifically named as unlisted securities in the SEC's filings against Coinbase and Binance. The trading app Robinhood [ended support](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/09/robinhood-ends-support-for-some-tokens-named-in-sec-lawsuit-as-securities/) for all three.

- **Bitcoin is holding up relatively better,** down "just" 4% over the past seven days. As a result, bitcoin dominance has risen [near 50%](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/10/bitcoin-now-accounts-for-nearly-half-of-the-101-trillion-crypto-market-tradingview-data-show/) of the entire global crypto market's valuation of $1 trillion.
