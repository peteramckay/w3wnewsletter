# Social's Billion User Club
## #Web3Weekly: April 9-15, 2023

**There are now six social networks** that each have more than a billion monthly active users.

Frankly, I stumbled across that striking little factoid the other day while working on another project. Below are the stats [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/), expressed in billions of MAU as of January:

- **Facebook:** 2.96
- **YouTube:** 2.51
- **WhatsApp:** 2
- **Instagram:** 2
- **WeChat:** 1.31
- **TikTok:** 1.05

**Why it matters:** Although the web remains an open platform to publish information, the numbers above highlight the challenge in getting real people to *actually pay attention* to what you publish in 2023.

The latter task often requires a proprietary social network, because people's time spent online has concentrated so drastically on social. (A proprietary search engine like Google can also accomplish the same thing, although that's outside the scope of the above data. But you get the point.)

The list also highlights *who* exactly controls access to all that user attention. Note that three of the six billion-user platforms are owned by Meta -- a.k.a. the company formerly known as Facebook -- which has been [trying furiously](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/28/facebook-name-change-rebrand-meta) for almost two years to convince us it's anything but a social company.

As you can see, that's complete bullshit. If your company is running three of the world's top six social networks, and the [vast majority of your company's revenue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/11/meta-mastodon-activitypub/) is coming from ad sales on those social networks, congratulations. You're still a social media company.

Two other billion-user platforms are based in China. In the West, WeChat has often been forgotten lately amid all the press heaped upon TikTok, because that's the only one we have access to here. But WeChat's success domestically in China is also extraordinary, underscoring the country's rise as a major market for internet services in its own right.

Finally, the other billion-user platform is Google-owned YouTube. Thus Google is the only entity that controls both a social network *and* a search engine in the top tier, which is downright mind-boggling.

On to the week's big headlines:

Decrypt review Andrew Hayward [characterized](https://decrypt.co/126218/solana-saga-review-web3-smartphone-arrived) the Saga as an interesting early-stage attempt at such a product.
