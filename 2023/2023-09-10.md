<!--

Remember new format! Do a longer riff (~650 words) followed by just 3-6 high-quality adds. Last one should be something light, as ever.

Some candidates for the lede story:

- EASYMONEY: Respond to the crypto-skeptical tome by Ben Whatshisface from Gotham.

- 4PART: The token market boils down to four parts imho -- bitcoin, ethereum, the major stablecoins, and everything else.

- ALTCOIN?: Are we past the point where it makes sense to call ETH an altcoin?

- FREESPEECH: Dedicate an edition to "free speech" issues the Silicon Valley set doesn't give a shit about. Jailed WSJ reporter Evan... Banned books in the U.S...

-->
