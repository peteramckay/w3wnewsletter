**It would be difficult to overstate** how negative the popular narrative about web3 was at this time a year ago.

The scars of FTX's meltdown in late 2022 were still fresh, sullying layman investors' perceptions of the token economy in general. Even among industry veterans, there was much fretting about how long "crypto winter" might last -- and how deep the losses might run. To boot, absolutely everyone worried the Federal Reserve's efforts to curtail U.S. inflation might tip the world's biggest economy into recession in 2023.

So what happened? Now that we've reached New Year's Eve, we know the answer.

In 2023, token prices roared higher. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was [convicted of fraud charges](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/business/ftx-sbf-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html) and very deservedly imprisoned. The Fed's rate hikes [paused](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-pause/) in the second half. And there was [no U.S. recession](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-the-economy-upended-expectations-of-a-recession-in-2023).

More in a moment about how we collectively pulled off this little miracle -- and what comes next. But first let's get to the year-end scorecard among major market benchmarks, listed from best performers to worst for 2023.

As ever, I include digital assets and conventional investments alike here:

- **Bitcoin:** +155.4%
- **Global Crypto Market Cap:** +106.9%
- **Ether:** +91.4%
- **Nasdaq 100:** +53.8%
- **Nasdaq Composite:** +43.4%
- **S&P 500:** +24.2%
- **Gold:** +13.2%
- **USD Index:** -2.0%
- **Crude Oil:** -11.4%

To summarize, crypto beat the daylights out of conventional investments in 2023, for a number of reasons.

In particular, investors began to position themselves late in the year in anticipation of two big events that will have to be confirmed (or not) in the New Year. One is a potential switch by the Fed to outright [cutting](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2023-12-13/fed-signals-three-rate-cuts-in-2024-end-of-higher-interest-rate-cycle) its official rate target, not just holding steady. That would favor bets on riskier assets as borrowing costs decline throughout the economy.

Second is the likely approval by U.S. regulators of one or more exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long resisted such a move, but it has increasingly seemed inevitable since the agency [lost a big court case](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/whats-stake-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-case-against-sec-2023-08-29/) to asset manager Grayscale Investments in August.

As an ex-stock market reporter, I'm also fascinated by a broader market trend recently described by Marc Rown, chief executive of Wall Street giant Apollo Global Management.

In a recent [interview with Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQjlvaKaNN4), Rowan said he sees a major recalibration underway in how investors see privately traded assets versus public ones, with the former increasingly gaining favor for anyone seeking outsized returns.

"We've had a sea change," Rowan said. " We're revisiting the notion of public being safe and private being risky. Now, 'private' just means less liquid."

Bitcoin posting a 2023 return more than six times that of the S&P 500 would seem to support that theory, I would say. If there is a long-term shift in investor psychology at play there, and if that change continues along a similar path in 2024, watch out.

A few other themes to watch in the New Year:

- **Bitcoiners are also anticipating a "halvening" in 2024.** This is a periodic, software-driven [event](https://crypto.com/university/bitcoin-halving-2024-what-to-know) that effectively cuts the supply of new coins being minted on the Bitcoin network. Previous halvenings have tended to boost BTC prices.

- **The chance of a comprehensive U.S. regulatory framework** for crypto passing Congress in '24 is almost nil. Our presidential election year just makes it even more politically infeasible, in my opinion. Sorry.

- **In the absence of real structural reform,** the SEC's hit-and-miss campaign of "rulemaking by enforcement" is [likely to continue](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/big-battles-loom-in-sec-s-war-on-crypto/ar-AA1m8Vdk), weighing heaviest on altcoins. We saw a [wave of de-listings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/cryptocurrency-delistings-from-exchanges-are-running-at-a-record-pace-this-year) of smaller crypto projects in 2023. And, to go back to our market scorecard, I find it telling that the annual gain in ether's price (91%) markedly lagged that of bitcoin (155%) and the global rise in token market cap as a whole (107%).

Reading between the lines here, it would seem that on-chain experimentation and building applications that may or may not eventually be deemed securities seems relatively out of favor, while the ["digital gold"](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/case-against-bitcoin-digital-gold) use case is on somewhat firmer regulatory footing. Sigh...

**Finally, a bit of housekeeping:** In the spirit of fresh starts, you might notice I've created a new logo for the newsletter. We've shortened things up from the old #Web3Weekly flag to simply #w3w.

The most important element, and the one I wanted to emphasize with this change, is that hashtag. I've always envisioned that it might be used to create a real conversation around the newsletter on social media, so I'm not just broadcasting out to the readers every week. I want to hear back from you as well.

That's more likely with a shorter (thus more user-friendly) hashtag. So here we are.

Please, use #w3w as a hashtag to talk about the newsletter on your favorite social network, or to flag me with stories of interest that you think I should include.

I'm active these days [on X](https://twitter.com/peteramckay) (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn, so I'm most likely to see you there. Or you can start communities of your own using the hashtag on other networks to talk to friends there about decentralization. Think of it as a small way to open source and expand the conversation we have here every week. ☺️
