# #Web3Weekly: Dec. 3-9, 2023

<!-- Brief intro. Not doing a full lead item this week... -->

**Crypto remains red hot** going into year-end both in terms of market performance and other industry news as well.

The token market's global valuation is up 15% so far in December, to $1.64 trillion in recent trading, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) data. That means it's now more than halfway back from the record $3 trillion valuation set in late 2021, generally regarded as the start of a new "crypto winter."

A little ironic to see this market thaw happen now, during *actual* winter. But hey. A metaphor always has its limits. ☺️

### Week in Review

- **Bitcoin posted a 10% weekly gain,** helped by the release of [strong jobs data](https://www.theblock.co/post/266709/bitcoins-price-rises-with-stocks-as-wall-street-assesses-us-jobs-data) in the U.S. on Friday. Over the last 30 days, BTC has soared 17% to a 20-month high above $44,000 per token. One downside: Network fees and congestion are [rising as well](https://decrypt.co/208945/rising-bitcoin-fees-prompt-renewed-battle-over-ordinals-brc-20-tokens).

- **The crypto news site Decrypt** is merging with podcaster Rug Radio, in a move that could help the site tap into a broader creator community. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/10/decrypt-rug-radio-merge-crypto))

- **Tether announced it will block wallets sanctioned by the United States** from using its stablecoin USDT. But on-chain data shows that the vast majority of the addresses currently don't currently hold any of the token. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/266894/tethers-new-sanctions-froze-161-wallets-only-eleven-hold-usdt))

- **Three U.S. presidential candidates** (not including either of the major-party frontrunrunners) will [hold a "crypto forum"](https://twitter.com/standwithcrypto/status/1730693103210635302) on Monday in New Hampshire at 2:30 Eastern as part of Coinbase's campaign #StandWithCrypto. You can RSVP to attend in person [here](https://cryptopresidentialforum.splashthat.com/). (No streaming details posted yet, but I would wager that either the #StandWithCrypto [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/standwithcrypto) or the website of the event's media partner [CoinDesk](https://coindesk.com) will be good places to look.)

- **In testimony to a U.S. Senate committee,** JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon urged members to "shut down" crypto altogether. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/12/06/jamie-dimon-crypto-senate-hearing-jpmorgan-blockchain-payments/))

- **The Bank for International Settlements** recently unveiled a [joint innovation project](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/a-newly-announced-blockchain-backed-system-could-transform-development-lending/) with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to use blockchain technology to speed up and secure transfers of money loaned to developing nations.
