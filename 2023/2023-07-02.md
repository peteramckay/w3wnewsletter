**Peter McCormack's podcast** recently hosted a great discussion of bitcoiners' sometime hypocrisy toward authoritarian regimes.

Ostensibly, [the episode](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/can-bitcoin-fix-the-imf-world-bank) with guests Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation and Natalie Smolenski of the Texas Bitcoin Foundation was about reforming the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Gladstein and Smolenski have been vocal in recent years about bitcoin's potential to upend these U.S.-based financial institutions' long-term ill effects on developing countries' ability to govern in the best interests of their own people.

Around the 35-minute mark of the show, the conversation turns inward a bit, toward bitcoiners' stance on dictators in the developing world. McCormack & Co lament that bitcoiners living in rich democracies like the U.S. and Britain often tend to be [too sanguine](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-uyghur-frances-suarez-china-question-miami-mayor-running-for-president/) about foreign governments with laissez-faire economics but brutal repression of civil liberties.

In effect, the panelists say the bitcoin community is sometimes so wooed by the former that it lets the latter slide. Gladstein colorfully refers to this as "[simping](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp) for dictators," citing as examples the absolute monarchy in low-tax United Arab Emirates and China's ostensibly communist (but pro-market when they need to be) authoritarian rulers.

As a bitcoin holder myself, and as an American who's about to celebrate our own Independence Day, this message really reverberated with me. Hence I want to amplify it here.

Yes, if some country's government is restricting bitcoin or other forms of blockchain innovation, I have a problem with that. But I will also always have a problem with *any* government that [conducts genocide](https://www.politico.eu/article/chinas-uyghur-abuses-may-constitute-crimes-against-humanity-un-finds/) or might [disappear a citizen](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/06/11/fear-of-a-wave-of-transnational-repression-among-arab-opponents-in-exile_6030829_4.html) for saying [the "wrong" thing](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56448688) about the country's leaders. Full stop.

That shouldn't be so hard to say, bitcoiner or not.

On to some other notable headlines:

- **The Securities and Exchange Commission** is unimpressed so far with proposals by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments to list new exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin. However, the issuers can amend their filings to address regulators' concerns, according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-says-spot-bitcoin-etf-filings-are-inadequate-390336e8?st=1fewipdm7zvjw1v&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink).
