# A post-turkey return
## #Web3Weekly: Nov. 26 to Dec. 2, 2023

**You might have noticed,** I took an extended break last weekend for the Thanksgiving holiday here in the U.S. But it's good to be back with you now, as there is once again much decentralization news to cover.

### Week in Review

- **Binance founder and former chief executive "CZ" Zhao** [stepped down](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/28/changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-from-binanceus-board/) as chairman of the exchange's U.S. affiliate. While Binance.US was not part of parent Binance's recent [$4.3 billion settlement](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/21/binance-to-settle-charges-with-us-doj-source/) with American regulators, it is still facing its own case with the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegely offering unregistered securities to U.S. investors.

- **Investors have moved $1.4 billion in bitcoin off exchanges since Nov. 14,** according to data from Glassnode. Such activity generally reflects bullish sentiment among investors, who bid bitcoin to a weekly gain of 6%. The token recently traded at an 18-month high near $40,000 per coin, bolstered by hopes for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and imminent U.S. regulatory approval of an exchange-traded fund holding bitcoin.

- **A new study by the University of Cambridge** shows that the Ethereum network produced carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to the nation of Honduras before its recent upgrade to a less energy-intensive protocol for verifying transactions. Energy usage is down 99% since, according to developers.

The consensus is decidely different now, to say the least.

- **Cardano has launched beta testing** for a new blockchain-based AI chatbot named Girolamo. ([CryptoSlate](https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-enters-beta-test-phase-for-new-blockchain-based-ai-chat-bot-girolamo/))
