# Going evergreen for "Crypto Summer"
## #Web3Weekly: July 2-8, 2023

**I'll be honest.** Now that the calendar has turned to July, part of me wants to take a summer break like when I was a kid. At the same time, I also have some very real, grown-up stuff to do right now, like moving to a new apartment.

Hence I've decided to do our regular news roundup today, then put the newsletter into low-maintenance mode through August.

That means the #Web3Weekly [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/web3weekly) and my regular sharing of newsletter content on [Medium](https://medium.com/@peteramckay) will go dormant. For email subscribers (because you're really my favorite ðŸ™ƒ), I'll be re-sharing each week one of my favorite third-party videos about the basics of web3.

In other words, you'll still hear from me. But the content will be less newsy and more ["evergreen,"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=evergreen) as we used to say when I worked in newspapers.

We'll resume our regular format on Sept. 3, including the news summary and regular social sharing.

Before I go, though, one last batch of summertime headlines:

- **The cross-chain platform Multichain** warned users not to use its services after experiencing an unexplained [$126 million outflow](https://www.theblock.co/post/238299/multichain-warning-outflow) of assets. Fallout reverberated throughot the crypto markets following the announcement. Stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether [froze $65 million](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:d2b740eb2094b:0-circle-tether-freezes-over-65m-in-assets-transferred-from-multichain/) in assets tied to the incident. Binance [suspended deposits and withdrawals](https://www.benzinga.com/23/07/33132921/binance-withdraws-support-for-several-tokens-with-links-to-the-multichain-bridge) of eight tokens traded via "bridges" to Multichain's platform.

- **BlackRock CEO Larry Fink** said in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX4FvW_Ph_sremarks) with Fox Business Network that bitcoin is displacing gold as a safe haven for investors and could "revolutionize finance".

Crypto traders have heavily speculated on such a scenario the last few weeks, bidding bitcoin to a [new 13-month high](https://www.forbes.com/sites/indiarice/2023/07/06/bitcoin-price-briefly-hits-13-month-high-as-blackrock-ceo-fuels-etf-fervor/) above $31,000 per token.
