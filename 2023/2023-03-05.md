**Coinbase has begun pushing back hard** against crypto's battered reputation and uncertain regulatory outlook, especially in the U.S. But will it work?

The exchange announced a new [grassroots lobbying campaign](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1630592674020335617) on Tuesday, including a national petition drive, to [influence pending crypto legislation](https://www.theblock.co/post/215829/coinbase-launches-grassroots-campaign-to-influence-us-lawmakers-and-regulators) in Congress. Coinbase has also been touting a [recent poll](https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/WvuOkBwNXZsqhd6EWtkEL/7f94f8b6fbb222f3faf4d0346e473012/Morning_Consult_Cryptocurrency_Perception_Study_Feb2023_Memo__1_.pdf) by partner Morning Consult showing widespread mistrust and discontent among Americans regarding the traditional financial industry.

Armed with that polling data, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sunnily touted crypto as a necessary "update" to the U.S. financial system in television interviews Thursday with [Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZobPKQYRyE&t) and [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrMtYuYV_Yw), as well as in [an essay](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/op-ed-offshoring-crypto-hurts-financial-system-americas-standing.html) on the latter's website.

At first glance, it might be easy to dismiss all this as predictable political axe grinding. But it somehow feels more significant to me, to be frank.

Look, Coinbase is by far America's largest publicly traded crypto company, with a market valuation near [$12 billion](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ticker+COIN&t=brave&ia=stock). It's like crypto's version of the Big Board or Goldman Sachs, to use Wall Street as a shorthand reference. Hence what Coinbase says on issues like the above *matters* for the entire industry, like it or not.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Shares of Silvergate crashed** after the publicly listed crypto bank [delayed filing](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/silvergate-capital-shares-drop-57-after-the-crypto-bank-delays-its-annual-report/ar-AA1893vp) its annual report late Wednesday, citing Crypto Winter-related struggles that may threaten its ability to remain in business.
