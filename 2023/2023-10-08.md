**If it seems obvious to you** that purposefully igniting a massive, unnecessary political crisis in America would be an awful way to protect the U.S. dollar's global status, congratulations. You are not Matt Gaetz.

The far-right Republican congressman set off [chaos in the U.S. House](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4240428-mccarthy-ousted-as-speaker-what-comes-next/) last week by ousting the chamber's speaker, Kevin McCarthy.

The politics at play are frankly outside the scope of this newsletter. But it did strike me as pertinent to hear Gaetz in an [interview with Bloomberg TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFQA6iYAT1g) on Thursday cite the economic risk of de-dollarization as a major reason for his legislative tantrum. He says he wanted more urgent action on this issue and thus felt he *had* to oust McCarthy.

De-dollarization refers to the idea that the greenback could someday lose its status as the global economy's reserve currency, with massive implications for trade, finance, and society in general.

It's a topic that also happens to be of keen interest to many bitcoiners, who would like to see BTC replace the greenback as the world's dominant currency. Pro-bitcoin authors like [Lyn Alden](https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Money-Financial-System-Failing/dp/B0CG8985FR) and [Saifedean Ammous](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) have written whole books that essentially lay out a data-driven, fundamental case against the dollar.

One of their chief worries (shared by Gaetz) is the steadily rising government debt in the U.S. and other advanced countries. America's national debt recently [hit $33 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/10/why-the-national-debt-can-both-help-and-hurt-the-us-economy.html) and is approaching 100% of our [gross domestic product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp).

The dollar's critics contend that this rising debt will eventually prove fatal to the U.S. currency. As the debt rises, the argument goes, America's government will have to print and sell more Treasury bonds, which effectively means printing more dollars. Then, as the amount of greenbacks in circulation increases, the currency will become devalued and eventually collapse altogether.

It's also worth noting, there are a lot of economists like Nobel winner Paul Krugman who insist such a doomsday scenario for the dollar [is unlikely](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/opinion/dollar-strength-reserve-currency.html).

I tend to fall somewhere in the middle of these two camps, to be honest. While it's certainly not *easy* for bitcoin or any other money to take the dollar's place globally, I don't think that scenario can be ruled out entirely either.

Periodically, the world's chief reserve asset has been displaced in the past, as happened in eras when gold and the British pound each were king. So *why not* a similar fate for the dollar at some point?

The other thing I struggle with here isn't so much data-driven but more a matter of sentiment. I believe there are signs of a creeping appetite outside the U.S. for a dollar alternative, if you know where to look.

For instance, even in making a [pro-dollar argument](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/opinion/dollar-strength-reserve-currency.html) back in July, Krugman noted the following. (Added emphasis is mine.):

*A lot of discussion focuses on the dollar’s share of foreign exchange reserves — cash hoards that nations maintain to deal with various economic shocks.* _**The dollar’s share of such reserves has indeed declined gradually over time, from 71 percent in 2000 to 58 percent in 2022.**_  *However, this decline mainly reflects diversification into smaller currencies such as the Canadian and Australian dollars, rather than a move to serious dollar rivals.*

Note that Krugman explains away the drop in reserves rather blithely, as mere "diversification into smaller currencies." But *why* do so many foreign governments want such diversification in the first place if the greenback is so awesome? And if they continue to diversify, won't those other currencies at some point *not* be so small anymore?

My hunch is that the rest of the world is warming to a key idea that bitcoiners like Ammous stress: Any government-issued fiat currency is inherently a political creation.

Perhaps the rest of the world is witnessing America's increasingly dysfunctional politics at home and recognizing them as an incentive to back away from the dollar. Maybe other countries don't want to be so tied economically to our domestic messes anymore -- stuff exactly like the current House brouhaha that Gaetz has set off.

When the Wall Street agency Fitch issued a highly unusual [downgrade](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-united-states-long-term-ratings-to-aa-from-aaa-outlook-stable-01-08-2023) of America's sovereign debt rating in August, it noted:

*"In Fitch's view, there has been a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters, notwithstanding the June bipartisan agreement to suspend the debt limit until January 2025. The repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions have eroded confidence in fiscal management."*

To put it a different way, economists tend to model the world around the idea of rational people acting to maximize their returns. But in the world we actually live in, the U.S. political system is in fact increasingly irrational.

That in itself is a big problem for the dollar.

The week's notable headlines:

- **FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's trial** on federal fraud charges began in New York. The biggest early development was testimony Thursday and Friday by former FTX executive Gary Wang. He said Bankman-Fried was fully aware that $8 billion in customer money had been moved from FTX to Alameda Research, a hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/technology/gary-wang-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-trial.html))

- **New challenges for Ethereum?** JPMorgan analysts said in a new research report that the number-two network has [become more centralized](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/06/ethereum-has-become-more-centralized-since-the-merge-and-shanghai-upgrades-jpmorgan/) following its recent transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm for verifying transactions and its upgrade to enable "liquid" trading of staked tokens. Separately, Bitcoinist reported on new metrics showing that the Tron network has [more daily active addresses](https://bitcoinist.com/tron-daily-active-addresses-ethereum/) than Ethereum, boosted largely by stablecoin transactions.

- **Global market vaulation of stablecoins** has fallen for 18 straight months, down 35% to $124 billion as of yesterday. A mix of factors is driving the slowdown, including reduced appetite for crypto among retail investors and higher interest rates on conventional bank deposits. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/200534/stablecoins-down-35-percent-against-treasury-yields))

- **More web3 layoffs:** Wallet maker [Ledger](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/05/crypto-custody-firm-ledger-cuts-12-of-staff/), NFT issuer [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://decrypt.co/200455/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-creator-yuga-labs-confirms-layoffs), and research firm [Chainalysis](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/03/blockchain-analytics-firm-chainalysis-cuts-15-staff/ ) all announced staff cuts. Sigh...

- **U.S. broadcast regulators levied the first-ever fine for space junk.** The Federal Communications Commission leveled a $150,000 penalty against TV provider Dish for failing to move one of its satellites into a safe orbit. The decision could ignite a market for services to dispose of old man-made devices in space. ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/05/1080999/first-space-junk-fine/))
