**Many famous entertainers** have offered either their work or collectibles for fans as non-fungible tokens lately. But two recent announcements by rock n' roll royalty show starkly different approaches to marketing the tokens.

David Bowie's estate [announced Thursday](https://decrypt.co/125653/unreleased-david-bowie-recording-debut-music-nft) it will offer a previously unreleased version of his hit Let's Dance as an NFT, with proceeds going to charity. Separately, the Rolling Stones will soon [offer  vintage photos](https://www.theblock.co/post/225338/rolling-stones-nfts-digital-certificates-of-authenticity) of the band, each offered in physical form paired with an NFT.

But there's a catch: The Stones are pitching their tokens as "Digital Certificates of Authenticity," or "DCOAs," eschewing the term "NFT." From a technical standpoint, there's really no difference. But the Stones seem wary of the "NFT" label as it took on a lot of baggage when prices plunged during last year's Crypto Winter.

The Block notes that television and movie studios have [used similarly vague language](https://www.theblock.co/post/225338/rolling-stones-nfts-digital-certificates-of-authenticity) lately in issuing collectible tokens, calling them anything but "NFTs."

For the broader market, it will be interesting to see if this rhetorical jiujitsu "sticks" in the months ahead. Perhaps some new term beside "NFT" will take over as the dominant nomenclature for these kinds of tokens? Or perhaps Bowie's method -- frankly *calling the thing what it is* using a name that works perfectly well already -- can make a comeback?

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Bitcoin mining difficulty** and hash rate hit [fresh all-time highs](https://www.theblock.co/post/225359/bitcoin-difficulty-hashrate-miner-revenue). Mining revenue was also up, rising to $755 million in March, according to The Block.

- **Uniswap trading volume handily topped Coinbase's**  in March, $70 billion to $49.2 billion. The decentralized Uniswap was particularly active during a brief period when the USDC stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar. But Coinbase could be due to push back ahead now as token markets are functioning more normally, [according to CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/06/uniswap-topped-coinbases-trading-volume-in-march-during-usdc-depeg-us-crackdown/).

- **The U.S. Treasury Department** published its [first detailed analysis](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf) of the crime and national security risks associated with decentralized finance protocols. Common criminals, terrorists, and North Korea's authoritarian regime are all using defi to steal and launder money, [Treasury said](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/06/us-treasury-warns-that-defi-used-by-north-korea-scammers-to-launder-dirty-money/). But it also noted that old-fashioned fiat cash is still used [far more widely](https://decrypt.co/125623/crooks-defi-crypto-fiat-treasury) for illicit activity.

- **Blogger Andy Baio** discovered that every modern version of macOS has been [hiding a copy](https://waxy.org/2023/04/the-bitcoin-whitepaper-is-hidden-in-every-modern-copy-of-macos/) of Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin whitepaper for years. Baio found it while fixing his printer. LOL.

- **Cointelegraph visited some Irish dairy farmers** who are turning [cow dung into bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVOJAWP688) as part of an emissions-reduction program. Wow...
