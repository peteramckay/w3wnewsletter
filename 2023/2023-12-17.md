# 'Tis the season for crypto giving
## #Web3Weekly: Dec. 10-16, 2023

**As this is my last newsletter before Christmas,** I'd like to highlight the Giving Block's excellent (and recently updated) [guide to donating crypto](https://thegivingblock.com/resources/a-complete-guide-to-donating-crypto/) to charitable causes.

Giving Block itself is a platform for connecting donors and nonprofits. But their guide isn't just a how-to regarding their own services. There is also a lot of good general info included about topics like claiming tax deductions for crypto donations, recordkeeping, and so on.

Of course, 2023 has been a banner year for crypto returns, with the token market's global valuation more than doubling to $1.6 trillion, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/). The holidays would be a great time to direct at least a little of that bounty to the less fortunate, if you're able.

Finally, one housekeeping note: I'll be taking next Sunday off for Christmas Eve. But I'll be back Dec. 31 with a year-end market wrapup.

Until then, I wish you all a happy holiday and safe travels if you'll be on the road. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüéÖüéÑ

### Week in Review

- **Crypto wallet maker Ledger suffered a security breach Thursday** that in turn affected multiple decentralized applications, including Zapper, SushiSwap, Phantom, Balancer, and Revoke.cash. Ledger quickly announced it had patched the compromised code. Meanwhile, users' monetary losses are still being tallied, with initial estimates in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/14/what-we-know-about-the-massive-ledger-hack/))

- **The long-term picture for crypto hacks may be improving, though.** Industrywide losses from security breaches fell nearly 50% in 2023 to $1.9 billion, according to data from Chainalysis. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-hacking-losses-plunge-nearly-50-2023-research))

- **Tether says** it has onboarded the FBI and US Secret Service to its compliance program in efforts to work more closely with law enforcement. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/267973/tether-weve-onboarded-fbi-secret-service-to-our-platform))

([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/209951/safemoon-files-for-bankruptcy-sfm-token-crashes-50-to-all-time-low))

- **In a new blog post,** Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin raised the possibility of moving some layer-2 functions [back to the main Ethereum blockchain](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/enshrined_zk_evm). Such an approach [could effectively reverse](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/13/ethereums-buterin-floats-prospect-of-taking-some-layer-2-functions-back-on-main-chain/) his earlier advocacy of third-party "rollups" to improve Ethereum's scalability.

- **Sales of the once-struggling Solana phone** are getting a boost thanks to an airdrop of the memecoin BONK for users of the device. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/14/sales-of-solana-phone-surge-as-traders-chase-bonk-arbitrage/))
