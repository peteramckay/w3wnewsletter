        <h4>June 28-July 4, 2020</h4>

      <br>

      <p>Big Tech's dominance is undeniably a complex problem to solve. That said, it strikes me we have just three main levers to fix the situation:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Government.</strong> The only force that can regulate or break up Death Star-sized tech companies, as multiple people have suggested of late.</li>

        <li><strong>Reputation.</strong> Big Tech companies don't want to lose customers, and their employees like to cast themselves as good people in general. Maybe we can use that to cajole or convince them simply to act better on their own.</li>

        <li><strong>Evolution.</strong> Build and adopt new products in lieu of the Death Stars' stuff to break their grip on markets and mindshare. Notice I didn't call this process "innovation" -- a somewhat abused word these days that only addresses makers' part of the equation. Users also have to play a role here by purposefully trying and migrating to new tools.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Frankly, I'd say some measure of each of the above approaches is probably in order right now, depending on which company and product category one is discussing. But in general, the option that's the most powerful, underutilized, and least discussed is the third -- evolution.</p>

      <p>As long as our conversation about tech is premised on the idea that everyone has to use Facebook until the sun flickers out in the sky, <strong>Facebook</strong> wins. Ditto with assuming <strong>Google</strong>'s permanent dominance in search, <strong>Amazon</strong>'s in retail, and so on.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this is exactly what most tech press and even some people in the tech industry itself tend to assume, often tacitly. These assumptions then have a nasty way of becoming self-fulfilling.</p>

      <p>The good news is that so could a vision of a world with less oligarchy if more people simply dared to imagine it, then set about making it happen, step by step.</p>

      <p>In that spirit, let's get to the latest headlines:</p>


      <ul>

        <li><strong>Ethereum</strong> transaction fees have hit their highest level in over two years, according to an analysis by <strong>TradeBlock</strong>. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ya8o9ezd">https://tinyurl.com/ya8o9ezd</a></em>) Bitcoinist's <strong>Nick Chong</strong> reports that developers are scrambling to find solutions -- or perhaps alternatives to ETH altogether. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y8e6xpdu">https://tinyurl.com/y8e6xpdu</a></em></li>

        <li>Motherboard's <strong>Jordan Pearson</strong> reports that some unknown party transferred bitcoins worth close to $1 billion in a single transaction Tuesday.

        <li>Fast Company's <strong>Kristin Toussaint</strong> took a look at how a mix of cameras and "smart city" design could replace traffic stops by police, leading to fairer enforcement and less violence against people of color. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yascdyck">https://tinyurl.com/yascdyck</a></em></li>

        <li>Several independent studies show <strong>Fox News</strong> may have kept millions of Americans from taking the coronavirus threat seriously. (Washington Post) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yde2wu8t">https://tinyurl.com/yde2wu8t</a></em></li>
