    <h1>Web 3.0 Week in Review</h1>
    <h4>Feb. 16-22, 2020</h4>
  </span>

  <p>Like a lot of people, I find TED talk videos to be a real hit-or-miss affair. They're either an utter time suck or downright brilliant, rarely anything inbetween.</p>

  <p>Squarely in the "brilliant" category is one by technologist <strong>Jennifer Zhu Scott</strong> on <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_zhu_scott_why_you_should_get_paid_for_your_data#t-855313">why you should get paid for your data</a>. The talk is from back in December, to be honest, but I just came across it last week thanks to a share from <a href="https://twitter.com/BraveSampson">Jonathan Sampson</a>, a developer on the <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a> web browser team.</p>

  <p>In layman-friendly terms, Scott lays out a great case why and how users are being financially exploited by data-harvesting tech companies. She also touches on the topic of privacy for privacy's sake -- the civil liberties aspect of surveillance capitalism -- but that's not her primary focus.</p>

  <p>Much as the civil liberties part is dear to some of us, myself included, it struck me listening to Scott that the <strong>"you're being ripped off"</strong> frame might be more effective at getting the masses to actually care about Big Tech's practices -- and to act.</p>

  <p>Speaking of which: Why are you still using <strong>Facebook</strong>, again?</p>

  <p>On to the latest decentralization news:</p>

 <ul>

   <li><strong>MIT researchers</strong> said they have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/voting-voatz-app-hack-issues-0213">found security vulnerabilities</a> in the blockchain-based voting app <strong>Voatz</strong>, which has already been used in Oregon, West Virginia, Washington, and Utah since 2018. The Voatz team scrambled to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/mit-finds-massive-security-flaws-with-blockchain-voting-app/">defend itself</a>, complaining that MIT had studied an old version of their app.</li>

   <li><strong>New Mexico's attorney general</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/technology/new-mexico-google-lawsuit.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against <strong>Google</strong> for violating schoolchildren's privacy. The company's Chromebooks are the leading brand of laptop in K-12 education, so this is definitely a case to keep an eye on.</li>

   <li><strong>Big developments at the major crypto exchanges.</strong> Forbes ran <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/02/19/coinbase-billionaire-brian-armstrongs-plan-to-make-bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-safe-for-all/#a1c5f0c345b0">an in-depth profile</a> of <strong>Coinbase</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Brian Armstrong</strong>, including some nifty factoids about the exchange giant's growth. Seems Coinbase now has about 35 million user accounts holding some $21 billion of assets, on track to generate about $800 million in revenue for the company this year. On Wednesday, they also announced a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2020/02/19/visa-grants-coinbase-power-to-issue-bitcoin-debit-cards/#763c57dc2e83">new partnership</a> with <strong>Visa</strong> to offer cryto debit cards outside the U.S. (Still too many regulatory hurdles here, apparently.) Separately, exchange competitor <strong>Binance</strong> is launching new cloud services that will diversify its business beyond trading, <strong>Bloomberg News</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-18/crypto-giant-binance-launches-cloud-service-in-revenue-shift">reported</a>.</li>

   <li><strong>Things are getting pretty controversial in decentralized finance right now, even by normal crypto nerdfight standards.</strong> (Which is saying something.) Traders marveled at a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-defi-flash-loan-attack">$350,000 profit someone made in seconds</a> using a "flash loan" on the Ethereum blockchain followed by several swaps involving other tokens in a single transaction, <strong>all for less than $9 in fees</strong>. The trade would perhaps constitute an illegal "round trip" transaction in traditional markets on Wall Street. But on blockchain... who knows? Meanwhile, <strong>SpankChain</strong> founder <strong>Ameen Soleimani</strong> said he's <a href="https://decrypt.co/18867/spankchain-ceo-has-radical-plan-for-ethereum-stablecoin-dai?&utm_source=coinbase&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=feed">found major flaws</a> in the governance of <strong>MakerDAO</strong>, which he threatened to exploit with a new project mockingly called <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1229848487098904576">TakerDAO</a>. Separately, the <strong>Depart of Justice</strong> indicted an Ohio man for allegedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136749/doj-ohio-helix-bitcoin-darknet-cryptocurrency-laundering-crime">laundering more than $300 million in bitcoin</a> via a process called “tumbling”.</li>

   <li>The social network <strong>Murmur</strong> said it is <a href="https://medium.com/telos-foundation/murmur-a-blockchain-powered-social-network-is-coming-to-telos-in-march-342b8c241d00">moving to the <strong>Telos</strong> blockchain</a> from <strong>EOS</strong>. Full disclosure: The <strong>Telos Foundation</strong>, which supports its namesake chain on an open-source basis, is a marketing client of mine. Frankly, I try not to bring them up too often in the newsletter, but this Murmur news seemed pretty significant. For perspective, the TLOS token has a market capitalization around $40 million, whereas EOS is about $4 billion, with a "b." So this is a clear case of an underdog pulling off an upset win. 😉</li>

    <li><strong>The toll from the coronavirus outbreak began to show in tech.</strong> This year's Mobile World Congress, perennially a major conference for the telcom industry, was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2020/02/12/mobile-world-congress-mwc-canceled-why-you-should-care/#6e91f662721f">canceled</a> after multiple sponsors and attendees pulled out due to fears of the bug. Meanwhile, Hong Kong protest leader <strong>Joshua Wong</strong> predicted in <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/culture/books/hong-kong-s-young-protest-leader-issues-a-call-to-arms-20200214-p540vq.html">an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald</a> that frustration with the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong>'s handling of coronavirus will lead to wider support for political reforms on the mainland.</li>

    <li>TRON founder <strong>Justin Sun</strong> took to Medium to <a href="https://medium.com/@TronFoundation/what-i-learned-from-warren-buffetts-dinner-by-justin-sun-2fc9f4c3f7a0">recap</a> his recent lunch with legendary investor <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>, which Sun won in a charity auction. Sounds like Sun gave the "Oracle of Omaha" a real hard sell on crypto and that Buffett repeatedly but silently reminded himself he was doing this s&%# for a good cause. </li>

    <li><strong>Finally, a couple of notable historic anniveraries, both triumphant and tragic.</strong> On Thursday, <strong>NASA</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1230538691971571712">marked 58 years</a> since the <strong>Friendship 7</strong> mission in which <strong>John Glenn</strong> became the first American to orbit Earth. On Friday, my old Wall Street Journal colleague <strong>Asra Nomani</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/AsraNomani/status/1230985767872274434">noted</a> the 18th anniversary of the murder of fellow reporter <strong>Daniel Pearl</strong> by al-Qaeda terrorists.</li>

  </ul>


<p>To be honest, I met Danny several times as a young Journal reporter but wasn't nearly as close to him as Asra, who sat vigil with Danny's wife after he was kidnapped in Pakistan. That said, I often think about his loss, which happened just a short time after the 9/11 attacks that those of us based at headquarters in New York experienced from just across the street. </p>

<p>To me, it is all one continuous series of related events. If not for 9/11, Danny wouldn't have been on a reporting trip to Pakiston to report on al-Qaeda in the first place, and thus never would have been kidnapped and killed. That's why whenever someone asks me if anyone from the Journal died on 9/11, my answer is always: "No, but..."</p>

<p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today. <!-- Email copy here: Best wishes for a productive week ahead.-->If you'd like to get updates like this in your inbox every Sunday, you can up for our email list <a href="https://indizr.com/newsletter/">here</a>.</p>
