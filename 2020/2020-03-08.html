    <h1>Web 3.0 Weekly</h1>
    <h4>March 1-7, 2020</h4>
  </span>

 <p><strong>Coronavirus</strong> continues to wreak some specific forms of havoc on the tech industry. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/media/sxsw-preparation-coronavirus/index.html">Add SXSW</a> to the list of canceled conferences, <strong>Stanford</strong> and <strong>University of Washington</strong> have both <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stanford-university-of-washington-cancel-classes-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-03-07?mod=hp_minor_pos19">canceled in-person classes</a>, some government websites in Asia are flagrantly <a href="https://theprint.in/world/amid-privacy-concerns-websites-in-singapore-hong-kong-track-coronavirus-patients/374780/">violating patient privacy</a> in the name of public health, and the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-02-21/will-the-coronavirus-cause-a-recession-podcast">threat of global recession</a> is running rampant.</p>

 <p>All that said, maybe there will be a silver lining if this sad situation finally prompts us to make better use of available, cost-efficient tech we've been underutilizing. To tell the truth, maybe we should have been doing more telecommuting, distance learning, and virtual conferences all along in lieu of schlepping to so many in-person events and meetings.</p>

 <p>This stuff is <em>there</em>. Why not use it? In many cases, it strikes me that the answer until now has essentially boiled down to pure inertia, habit, and organizational culture.</p>

<p>For instance, tenured faculty accustomed to in-person classrooms simply don't <em>like</em> distance learning; there's really no other reason why the academy hasn't embraced it more widely before. But the strict in-person approach also severely limits who has access to higher ed in the first place. So there's a massive downside in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp">opportunity cost</a> that's rarely discussed.</p>

 <p>Similar situation with bosses who just <em>like</em> micromanaging white-collar workers in physical offices over remote working. Fine for the company, but it's hell on anyone who has to care for children or elders. Plus it imposes on workers the massive time suck that is physical commuting in general, as well as environmental impact that we all have to deal with.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, there's this virtual space called "the internet" where most white-collar workers are actually doing most of their work anyway. So, yeah, f&^% the micromanagers who set off the whole miserable, unnecessary chain reaction.</p>

<p>For once, maybe we're entering a phase where the luddites have to play defense and actually justify the old ways, rather than the changemakers having to justify <em>them</em>selves, as often happens within organizations.</p>

<p>Mind you, maybe in some cases there really is good reason to maintain status quo. But if not... hey...</p>

<p>Hello, progress.</p>

<p>On to the latest decentralization headlines:</p>

 <ul>

   <li>Legendary technologist <strong>Bruce Schneier</strong> <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/02/inrupt_tim_bern.html">blogged about</a> his recent decision to join the startup <strong>Inrupt</strong> as Chief of Security Architecture. His post also doubles as a handy explainer of <strong>Solid</strong>, the open standard that Inrupt is using to implement web inventor <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>'s vision of a decentralized "web of data" that reduces the power of current Big Tech middlemen.</li>


   <li><strong>West Virginia</strong> will <a href="https://www.govtech.com/products/West-Virginia-Pauses-Use-of-Voatz-Voting-App-Cites-Security.html">stop using</a> the blockchain-based voting app <strong>Voatz</strong> following a recent MIT report about the app's security vulnerabilities. The state will instead switch to <strong>Democracy Live</strong>, which is hosted on <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> infrastructure. Groan...</li>


   <li><strong>Asian governments continued to send mostly positive signals on crypto adoption.</strong> The Supreme Court of India <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/indias-supreme-court-lifts-banking-ban-on-crypto-exchanges">overturned</a> its earlier ban on crypto exchanges. The South Korean National Assembly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/south-korea-passes-one-of-the-worlds-first-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-laws/">passed a law</a> to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto, including clear "know your customer" and anti-money laundering measures. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's deputy governor said in a speach that the country <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/japan-doesnt-need-a-digital-yen-asserts-boj-official?utm_source=hootsuite&utm_medium=twitter&utm_term=Events&utm_content=Register&utm_campaign=FATF">probably doesn't need</a> an official digital currency of its own, bucking a trend exemplified by neighboring China. Japan's consumers, however, remain among the most <a href="https://www.skalex.io/crypto-japan/">enthusiastic crypto adopters</a> in the world.</li>


    <li>Ethereum developer <strong>Hudson Jameson</strong> published a much-discussed <a href="https://hudsonjameson.com/2020-03-02-progpow-the-ethereum-community-speaks/">blog post</a> about the Programmatic Proof of Work consensus method. The algo, known as "ProgPow" for short, has been controversial in the Ethereum community recently and is likely "dead" at this point due to vocal dissent to its adoption by the Ethereum network, Jameson says.</li>



    <li><strong>Bloomberg News</strong> reports that the Facebook-led <strong>Libra Association</strong> is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-03/facebook-weighs-libra-revamp-to-win-over-reluctant-regulators">considering a significant redesign</a> of their proposed stablecoin to assuage reluctant regulators around the world. The Libra network may accept multiple coins, including those issued by the increasing number of global central banks looking to launch their own official tokens.</li>


   <li>Activist investor <strong>Paul Singer</strong> has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/elliot-managements-paul-singer-seeks-to-replace-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-source-says.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain">launched a campaign</a> to remove Twitter founder <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> as the social network's CEO. The argument against <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">@jack</a> is that he's splitting his time between Twitter and Square, where's also CEO. Plus he's said he plans to move to Africa. Meanwhile, Twitter has consistently lagged rival Facebook's growth. So, yeah... Probably not a good look when you add all that up.</li>


   <li><strong>Fortune</strong> reports that venture investment in woman-founded startups <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/03/02/female-founders-funding-2019/">rose to $3.5 billion</a> in 2019. The bad news: That was still only about 2.7 percent of total VC investment. Or, to put it a different way, that's less than the $5 billion that <strong>SoftBank</strong> invested in <strong>WeWork</strong> alone -- an epic financial dumpster fire. Speaking of which...</li>

   <li><strong>"Yogababble,"</strong> a shorthand that business professor <strong>Scott Galloway</strong> coined in reference to the messaianic claims of supposedly world-changing tech companies like WeWork, is now <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yogababble">listed in Urban Dictonary</a>. Next stop: Webster's, baby!</li>

   <li><strong>ProPublica</strong> reported on <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/matt-bevin-kentucky-information-highway-high-speed-internet">Kentuckyâ€™s botched efforts</a> to bring high-speed internet access to its rural areas. The state has gotten scant results after spending over $1.5 Billion on the problem so far.</li>


   <li>Noted: Veteran tech journalist <strong>Josh Topulsky</strong> seems to have <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/1234895299145060354">reached the limits of his patience</a> with Facebook.</li>

   <li>Finally, you may have noticed a slight branding change to the newsletter today. I'm changing its name slightly to <strong>Web 3.0 Weekly</strong> instead of the <strong>Web 3.0 Week in Review</strong>. This little brevity hack just smacked me in the face, so I decided to run with it. ðŸŒž</li>
