      <p><strong>You might have noticed</strong> (or maybe not) that the newsletter took a hiatus last week. There was good reason for this, I'm happy to report.</p>

      <p>I've been working on a new website for <strong>#Web3 Weekly</strong>, which is now live at <a href="https://w3w.news">w3w.news</a>. For now, the site's primary function is to collect signups for new subscribers. So please do share with friends or colleagues who might enjoy this newsletter's unique take on tech in their inboxes every Sunday. ðŸ˜‰</p>

      <p>Over time, I plan to add other features to the site to highlight #Web3 Weekly content. But fear not, e-mail will remain the primary distribution channel, as I think it's a great alternative to the Facebook-Google duopoly that's otherwise completely screwed content producers everywhere for years.</p>

      <p>Now, let's get to the latest headlines:</p>
