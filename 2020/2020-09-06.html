      <p>Honestly, I'm not certain the internet as a whole got less centralized last week. But people's money sure did:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Crypto trading volume on decentralized exchanges jumped to $11.6 billion in August,</strong> more than double the previous month's activity, according to new data from <strong>Dune Analytics</strong>.  (<em>See <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/76545/dex-trade-volume-august">https://tinyurl.com/y3xp3ofa</a></em>) DEX trades take place directly on-chain and in some ways may be harder for regulators to trace than transactions on company-controlled platforms like <strong>Coinbase</strong>. Much of the recent DEX volume has been driven specifically by the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform <strong>Uniswap</strong>, though upstart <strong>SushiSwap</strong> is now trying to steal its thunder. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uniswap-defi-pulse-tvl-leader-sushiswap">https://tinyurl.com/y2hvtwcl</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>DeFi also remains the driving force in the broader Ethereum ecosystem, where transaction fees hit a new daily record.</strong> ETH miners generated all-time high fee revenue of $17 million on Tuesday, according to data from <strong>The Block Research</strong>. The figure was more than 10 times bicoin miners' revenue on Tuesday and almost quadruple ETH's own previous record. <em>Link: <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/76686/ethereum-miners-fee-revenue-all-time-high-september">https://tinyurl.com/y3a5vmsd</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Grayscale Investments</strong>, the largest crypto fund management firm, tweeted that it now has more than <strong>$6 billion</strong> in client assets under management. <em>Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1300533096656273411">https://tinyurl.com/y6ttf95j</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>The Telos Foundation</strong> announced that the application develpment firm <strong>Katalyo</strong> will tokenize <strong>$35 million </strong>worth of waterfront real estate in Croatia on the Telos blockchain. The project is potentially a major boon to the Telos platform, whose native token has a market cap of less than $8 million. (Full disclosure: The Telos Foundation is a freelance client of mine.) <em>Link: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/telos-will-tokenize-35-million-of-croatian-seafront-real-estate">https://tinyurl.com/y24kk4vv</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Ian Lee</strong>, managing director of <strong>IDEO CoLab Ventures</strong>, predicted that "fair launches" will disrupt venture capital in the crypto space, allowing more projects to launch without support from Silicon Valley's traditional kingmakers. <strong>Fair launches entail no pre-mining of tokens</strong> or other features that create outsize gains for founders and other early participants in a new crypto offering. <em>Link: <a href="https://synthesis.substack.com/p/fair-launches-will-disrupt-crypto">https://tinyurl.com/yyoppwx5</a></em></li>

        <li>The browser maker <strong>Brave</strong>'s research arm published a post summarizing their recent work, including updates on machine learning, data privacy and security, performance, and cryptography. <em>Link: <a href="https://brave.com/updates-from-brave-research/">https://tinyurl.com/y4478web</a></em></li>

        <li>In a new Wall Street Journal video report, my friends <strong>Lingling Wei</strong> and <strong>Bob Davis</strong> gave a good overview of how <strong>China and America are rapidly "decoupling" in tech</strong>. Over the next few years, two online ecosystems may emerge, separated from the bare metal hardware layer right up through services, the WSJ says. <em>Link: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/tech-decoupling-china-race-to-end-its-reliance-on-the-us/0BFA6A39-D394-4E83-8835-A8F6BDE62370.html">https://tinyurl.com/y48kbs9x</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Amazon</strong> posted and then hastily deleted job openings for <strong>"intelligence analysts"</strong> to help the company identify "labor organizing threats" after the listings created a viral uproar on social media. (See Wired magazine's full coverage at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxsj67lv">https://tinyurl.com/yxsj67lv</a>) A screen capture of the job postings was shared by <strong>Athena</strong>, an alliance opposing Amazon's increasing economic and societal influence, at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxqsg6x4">https://tinyurl.com/yxqsg6x4</a></li>

        <li>Author and digital activist <strong>Cory Doctorow</strong> published a handy how-to on destroying surveillance capitalism. <em>Link: <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://tinyurl.com/y4ssceus</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>A brainstorm:</strong> Perhaps we should hire whoever does <strong>supply chain for Oreos</strong> to handle protective equipment for U.S. hospital workers as well. Seems there are now 58 varieties of those cookies, and every damn one is consistently in stock at the supermarket. <em>Link: <a href="https://indizr.com/img/oreos.jpeg">https://tinyurl.com/y6pf8cwe</a></em></li>

      </ul>
