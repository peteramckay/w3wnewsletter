    <h1>Web 3.0 Weekly</h1>
    <h4>March 29-April 4, 2020</h4>
  </span>

  <p>Aside from some canceled conferences, the tangible effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the business of tech began to come into focus this week. To wit:</p>

 <ul>

   <li><strong>New York's attorney general</strong> is looking into <strong>Zoom</strong>'s privacy practices. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-new-york-attorney-general-privacy-practices-2020-3">news</a> weighed on the videoconferencing provider's stock last week, but it has nevertheless been a big winner since the outbreak of COVID-19 as usage of Zoom's applications to replace in-person meetings has grown. Zoom shares are up  22 percent since the end of February, now trading at 1,400 times the company's earnings over the last 12 months, according to data from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM?p=ZM&.tsrc=fin-srch">Yahoo Finance</a>.</li>

   <li><strong>Facebook</strong>, which until a few months ago was worried about being broken up by Congress, is suddenly <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sheryl-sandberg-how-facebook-getting-back-in-washingtons-good-graces-183101399.html">making nice</a> with lawmakers, working on ways to share user location data to better understand the health crisis. Similar situation with <strong>Google</strong> and other Big Tech peers. Yay?</li>

   <li><strong>SoftBank</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/softbank-ends-3-billion-wework-tender-offer-cites-failed-closing-conditions/">pulled out</a> of its $3 billion follow-on investment/bailout of troubled <strong>WeWork</strong>. The Tokyo-based investment firm explained the move by saying "certain conditions to the tender offer were not satisfied," according to <strong>ZDNet</strong>. WeWork immediately <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/03/meetup-divested-by-wework-for-a-fraction-of-what-it-paid/">sold off</a> the events site <strong>Meetup</strong> to a group led by <strong>Alley Corp.</strong> as an alternative way to raise cash. However, the sale price was reportedly a fraction of the $156 million that WeWork paid in 2017, according to <strong>AlleyWatch</strong>, which follows the New York tech scene. So the company is way short of the infusion it hoped to raise from SoftBank.</li>

   <li>Internet pioneer <strong>Vint Cerf</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/vgcerf/status/1244636584508604417">announced</a> on Twitter that he has tested positive for COVID-19 but is recovering. He also encouraged people to watch comedian <strong>John Oliver</strong>'s recent segment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElIf2DBrWzU">lambasting</a> the White House's response to the virus.</li>

   <li><strong>"Americans don't realize how lucky they are to have the USD,"</strong> wrote angel investor <strong>Qiao Wang</strong>, of <strong>Messari Crypto</strong>, in a <a href="https://twitter.com/QWQiao/status/1245002883038355456">Twitter thread</a> about the economics of the COVID-19 crisis. If you read the full thread, you'll see his praise of the greenback is ultimately somewhat left-handed, pointing toward a future where alternatives have to emerge. But his comments interested me as a more balanced view of traditional finance than you'll hear from most crypto bros, frankly.</li>

   <li>I wrote a <a href="https://digitalprivacy.news/2020/04/03/understanding-cookies-on-the-web/">layman-friendly explainer</a> about the privacy implications of cookies for <strong>Digital Privacy News</strong>, a new project by the nonprofit <strong>Magnusson Institute</strong>. If you're wondering what these pesky things you're always getting prompted about are, and what you can do about them, <a href="https://digitalprivacy.news/2020/04/03/understanding-cookies-on-the-web/">check it out</a>.</li>


   <li><strong>Finally, some virus-related odds and ends:</strong> I thought <strong>David Brooks</strong> wrote quite eloquently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/coronavirus-meaning.html">here</a> about COVID-19 as a moral crisis... Sci-fi novelist <strong>Ted Chiang</strong> talked to Electric Lit's <strong>Halimah Marcus</strong> about how the current situation <a href="https://electricliterature.com/ted-chiang-explains-the-disaster-novel-we-all-suddenly-live-in/">compares to dystopia fiction</a>... Through its foundation, the <strong>U.S. Bartenders Guild</strong> has started a <strong>Bartender Emergency Assistance Program</strong> for workers whose pubs and restaurants have shut down. You can <a href="https://tinyurl.com/rr6873g">donate here</a> if you'd like.</li>
