    <h1>Web 3.0 Weekly</h1>
    <h4>March 22-28, 2020</h4>
  </span>

  <p>There's an old saying among journalists that three of anything makes a trend. In other words, three is the magic number of tangible examples of a lowercase-t thing that justifies doing a story declaring it to be an uppercase-t Thing, if you see what I mean.</p>

  <p>It struck me this week that truly world-shaking catastropes have become a real Thing. A trend.</p>

  <p>In less than 20 years, we've now had three of them by my (admittedly subjective) count: the 9/11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, and now coronavirus.</p>

  <p>The commonality is that these events transcend mere surface-level badness; they are (or were) all destabilizing, life-changing episodes for broad swaths of humanity. They upend markets and economies and political systems. Any one of them, let alone a combination, would probably work as a plotline in an Avengers movie if it hadn't happened in real life.</p>

  <p>Three of those in less than two decades strikes me as a <em>really</em> rapid pace. Offhand, it strikes me we're all going to have to make some pretty radical changes personally and professionally if this level of calamity is going to become a regular feature of the world around us from now on. (And, to think, my Big Three list above doesn't even include anything related to climate change.)</p>

  <p>If it sustains, this sort of instability will also have major implications for the internet, which of course is the focus around here. It will deeply affect how people use the network, the things we make for it, the pecking order of companies that are winners and losers, and so on.</p>

  <p>This week's headlines illustrate that point pretty neatly, I think. Let's get to them:</p>

 <ul>

   <li><strong>Stablecoins remain a hot commodity as global recession looms.</strong> On his podcast, <strong>CoinDesk</strong> editor <strong>Adam B. Levine</strong> recapped how <strong>MakerDAO</strong> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/how-makerdaos-stablecoin-survived-the-crash-smart-contract-bugs-and-full-decentralization">weathered recent market volatility</a> to stabilize its dollar-pegged DAI token, whose price briefly decoupled from the greenback last week... <strong>An early version of the U.S. Senate's stimulus bill</strong> included a provision for creating an <strong>official "digital dollar"</strong> to help distribute stimulus funds to citizens. But the proposal <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/digital-dollar-stripped-from-latest-us-coronavirus-relief-bill">didn't make it into the House version of the stimulus bill</a> that ultimately passed and went to the White House for the president's signature into law... Meanwhile, <strong>the New York Times profiled Venezuelan dissident Gabriel Jiménez</strong>, who put aside his differences with the Maduro dictatorship to <strong>help create a digital bolivar</strong>, believing it would be for the greater good of his countrymen. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/technology/venezuela-petro-cryptocurrency.html">Things didn't go as well</a> as Jiménez hoped, to say the least.</li>


      <li><strong>Brave</strong> is partnering with <strong>Binance</strong> to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/brave-partners-with-binance-to-develop-in-browser-crypto-trading">add crypto trading features</a> to their browser.</li>


      <li>A federal judge ordered <strong>Telegram</strong> to refrain from issuing its own cryptocurrency next month as planned, granting a request by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>. The market regulator is alleging that Telegram violated securities laws with a previous token sale, Coindesk <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/judge-halts-telegram-token-issuance-222536745.html">reports</a>.</li>



     <li><strong>MIT researchers</strong> are <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615374/an-mit-team-hopes-to-publish-open-source-designs-for-a-low-cost-ventilator/">working</a> on an open-source design for a low-cost respirator.</li>


     <li><strong>A group of kids</strong> in San Francisco's Bernal Heights neibhorhood is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/This-kid-staffed-SF-newspaper-is-the-coronavirus-15164210.php">producing a digital newspaper</a> called <strong>Six Feet of Separation</strong> about dealing with social distancing.</li>



   <li><strong>Google</strong> has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-bans-infowars-android-app-alex-jones-coronavirus/">banned</a> the <strong>Infowars</strong> app from its Play Store for spreading misinformation about COVID-19. Cue someone kvetching about the free speech implications of tech companies moderating their platforms. Cue me looking for the world's smallest violin.</li>


<!--
   <li>Blockchain's storytelling problem: https://unchainedpodcast.com/blockchain-techs-storytelling-problem-and-how-to-solve-it/</li>



   <li>O'Reilly Media just canceled all future in-person conferences and permanently shuttered that part of their business. They don't plan to host a physical OSCON, Strata, Velocity, etc ever again. https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/from-laura-baldwin.html</li>

-->

   <li>On a happier note, a new highlight among the several online concerts that have sprung up since everyone's been confined indoors: <strong>The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra</strong> posted <a href="https://twitter.com/Khanoisseur/status/1243954960037003266">a performance of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy"</a> with 19 musicians playing their parts from their homes.</li>


  </ul>
