      <p>No doubt about it, decentralized finance increasingly looks like the blockchain space's new <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=killer%20app">killer app</a>. Several recent developments show it taking on more functions akin to those of traditional banks:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Bitcoin is becoming a DeFi juggernaut.</strong> CoinDesk's <strong>Zack Voell</strong> reports that more bitcoins have been wrapped and put on the Ethereum chain lately than created through mining. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y55rd7xn">https://tinyurl.com/y55rd7xn</a></em>) Wrapped BTC can be used more readily by lending apps running on the Etehreum chain. Separately, <strong>Coinbase</strong> announced it will allow customers in 17 U.S. states to borrow in dollar terms against up to 30% of their BTC holdings beginning this fall. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5pcglfz">https://tinyurl.com/y5pcglfz</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>The rapid rise and fall of the YAM token illustrated DeFi's potential pitfalls, however.</strong> The project launched Tuesday as a vehicle for an arbitrage strategy called yield farming, quickly grew to a market cap of nearly $500 million, and then crashed 90 percent days later after a bug in the system was discovered. (The Block) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3bfdufp">https://tinyurl.com/y3bfdufp</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>China has outlined plans for further tests of its new "digital yuan,"</strong> expanding its pilot program to include Beijing and Hong Kong. (Bloomberg) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6pyt8bw">https://tinyurl.com/y6pyt8bw</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>MicroStrategy</strong>, a Nasdaq-listed software company worth $1.2 billion, disclosed in a new regulatory filing that it has <strong>purchased $250 million in bitcoin</strong> as an inflation hedge. The move could pave the way for other public companies to purchase cryptoassets for the first time, writes fund manager <strong>Christopher Brookins</strong>. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y48bs2k7">https://tinyurl.com/y48bs2k7</a></em></li>

        <li>The Block's <strong>Frank Chaparro</strong> reports that <strong>J.P. Morgan</strong> is in talks to invest $20 million in <strong>ConsenSys</strong> as part of a $50 million convertible debt funding round. As part of the deal, ConsenSys would take over maintenance and support of <strong>Quorum</strong>, the banking giant's Ethereum-based blockchain platform. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6jg46tx">https://tinyurl.com/y6jg46tx</a> (Paywall)</em></li>

        <li>The <strong>U.S. Justice Department</strong> announced it had seized millions of dollars worth of cryptoassets from accounts belonging to <strong>al-Qaeda and other terror groups</strong>, the agency's largest such crackdown to date on such activity. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6kr7anj">https://tinyurl.com/y6kr7anj</a></em></li>

<li><strong>A tragic twist on the recent widespread adoption of distance learning:</strong> A Florida man shot his ex-girlfriend dead while her 10-year-old daugher's online class was streaming on the first day of school. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y34c38a8">https://tinyurl.com/y34c38a8</a></em></li>

        <li>Bloomberg's <strong>Gerry Smith</strong> reports that <strong>cable technicians</strong> in the U.S. are increasingly concerned about <strong>catching coronavirus from maskless customers</strong> during service visits. A handy reminder to wear a mask and/or not subscribe to cable in the first place. It's 2020, people. Streaming works. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2jhrldd">https://tinyurl.com/y2jhrldd</a></em></li>
