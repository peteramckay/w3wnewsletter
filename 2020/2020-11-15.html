      </span>

      <br>

      <p><strong>We're all either stuck inside or are at least traveling a lot less than usual for business these days.</strong> With that in mind, I have a few community-related notes to start with this time:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>In preparation for the Ethereum 2.0 launch, the Ethereum Foundation is offering a new round of staking community grants.</strong> Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals for building and documenting the new network by Dec. 22. For more info, visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxfxgowy">https://tinyurl.com/yxfxgowy</a></li>
        <li><strong>The Aspen Institute's Tech Policy Hub</strong> has a virtual event coming up Wednesday (Nov. 18) at 4 p.m. Pacific to celebrate the end of the pilot of its new Tech Executive Leadership Initative, an eight-week program to prepare experienced tech leaders to engage effectively with public-sector challenges. To sign up for the event, visit <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2vktlhw">https://tinyurl.com/y2vktlhw</a></li>
        <li><strong>My old friend and colleague Zach Seward is taking the business news site Quartz independent.</strong> In a new CEO's note at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6xlglow">https://tinyurl.com/y6xlglow</a> Zach lays out his vision of what this means for the site's already excellent journalism, which they'll be supporting through a membership business model. Might be worth joining if you've got an appetite for business news that's smart, global, entrepreneurial, and all digital. In other words, no dead trees! üòÄ</li>
      </ul>

      <p>OK, now for some headlines. Several doozies to get to this time:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>The Ethereum network suffered an "accidental" hard fork on Nov. 11.</strong> A latent bug split the network‚Äôs transaction history in two, temporarily causing many apps built on Ethereum to go dark, including the bulk of the decentralized finance ecosystem of lending apps. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y32k925f">https://tinyurl.com/y32k925f</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>PayPal's rollout of new crypto features continues.</strong> The company said it has removed a waitlist for U.S. users to get access to four crypto tokens -- Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. It now anticipates that remaining U.S. customers would get access to crypto by year end, with plans to add crypto services internationally and on its Venmo service in 2021. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2acqwu8">https://tinyurl.com/y2acqwu8</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>The European Union and China each took action against tech giants,</strong> underscoring deepening wariness of the sector among the world's governments. The EU sued Amazon for antitrust violations over its use of data from vendors who sell products on the Amazon platform that compete with Amazon's own in-house brands. (See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2tzp6zm">https://tinyurl.com/y2tzp6zm</a>) Separately, China abruptly halted Ant Group's highly anticipated $37 billion initial stock offering. The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese leader <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> personally put a stop to the IPO following remarks by Ant founder <strong>Jack Ma</strong> at a conference that "infuriated" the country's regulators. (See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yygdcd3u">https://tinyurl.com/yygdcd3u</a>)</li>

        <li><strong>Wall Street continued its gradual embrace of crypto, with one notable dissenter.</strong> In an interview with CNBC, billionaire investor <strong>Stanley Drukenmiller</strong> disclosed that he's been buying bitcoin as a small component of his portfolio. (See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y69455z9">https://tinyurl.com/y69455z9</a>) Bloomberg Intelligence strategist <strong>Mike McGlone</strong> tweeted that the market's recent momentum suggests bitcoin will hit an all-time record above $20,000 next year. (See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3glp5vj">https://tinyurl.com/y3glp5vj</a>) However, <strong>Ray Dalio</strong>, founder of the giant hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance he anticipates crypto's future will be limited as governments are likely to ban bitcoin or other tokens when they become a "material" threat to official currencies. (See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yynt66vo">https://tinyurl.com/yynt66vo</a>)</li>


        <li><strong>Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, said a digital euro is likely.</strong> Speaking at an online forum hosted by the ECB, Lagarde said her "hunch" is that ECB will launch a digital euro in two to four years. On the same panel, her peers were more cautious about any plans to digitize their respective currencies. Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> said the Fed will ‚Äúcarefully and thoughtfully‚Äù review the issue, and Bank of England Governor <strong>Andrew Bailey</strong> said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúlot of hard work to think through the implications.‚Äù(Bloomberg) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5csbr9s">https://tinyurl.com/y5csbr9s</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>The crypto industry is seeing some early promise in the Biden administration.</strong> In an interview with Forbes, <strong>Kristin Smith</strong>, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a trade group representing the cryptocurrency industry in Washington, said: ‚ÄúI think what we see with a Biden administration is an opportunity to get some fresh faces into the key regulatory agencies that might be more willing than some of the other regulators that we have today to move forward on policies that would be good for crypto.‚Äù At the top of the administration, current President Trump has expressed blanket opposition to crypto, whereas Biden's posture as the incoming president is seen as potentially more open. In particular, industry insiders welcomed Biden's recent appointment of <strong>Gary Gensler</strong> to head the regulatory component of his transition. Gensler is an ex-Goldman Sachs banker who later chaired the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As CFTC head, he sometimes defended the potential of crypto markets in hearings before skeptical legislators on Capitol Hill. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y43ea67c">https://tinyurl.com/y43ea67c</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Bitpay launched a new service for businesses to handle crypto payments more easily.</strong> The new offering, dubbed BitPay Send, enables both customer and employee-related payments without the business handling or owning crypto itself. (Cointelegraph) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y63gncry">https://tinyurl.com/y63gncry</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>The web's inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, announced a new enterprise server product from his startup Inrupt.</strong> The new server is built on Solid, an open, more user-focused data standard that Lee has championed in recent years as an antidote to centralized, privacy-violating services. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yy9wom3t">https://tinyurl.com/yy9wom3t</a></em></li>
