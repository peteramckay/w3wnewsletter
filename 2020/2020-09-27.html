      <p><strong>FWIW, I enthusiastically second the Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong>'s new call to end the dreaded paywall for <strong>PACER</strong>, the U.S. federal courts' electronic records system.</p>

      <p>EFF's full rant was published Tuesday at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3gt69oh">https://tinyurl.com/y3gt69oh</a>.</p>

      <p>Among a bunch of other news about government and politics in the U.S. lately, it's certainly understandable if this particular issue has escaped your attention. But I can vouch firsthand, PACER is insanely expensive, antiquated in an era of free access to most other public information, and ultimately one more blight on our democracy.</p>

      <p>A glance at the summary of PACER's fees at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2nbgehl">https://tinyurl.com/y2nbgehl</a> demostrates that <strong>it's essentially priced as a specialized professional service for lawyers.</strong> But this absurdly overlooks the needs of journalists and the general public to use the system as well.</p>

      <p>In my newspaper days, I often needed case files about newsworthy proceedings that went on for hundreds of pages, with multiple documents. So the fees would add up quick, all for information that belongs to the public anyway. What sense does that make?</p>

      <p>On to the week's other headlines:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Time's Billy Perrigo</strong> reports that popularity of the encrypted messaging app <strong>Signal</strong> is surging in the U.S. as protests against systemic racism and police brutality have intensified recently. <strong>Downloads were up 50% between March and August compared to the prior six months</strong>, according to data shared with Time by the analysis firm App Annie. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yyd9g8ts">https://tinyurl.com/yyd9g8ts
          </a></em></li>

          <li><strong>The latest data from Brave</strong> show 18.3 million monthly active users and 6.1 million daily active users of the company's privacy-focused web browser through August. <em>Link: <a href="https://brave.com/transparency/">https://brave.com/transparency</a></em></li>


          <li><strong>The gas is too damn high.</strong> UniLogin, which was trying to build a standard solution for managing user identities in distributed apps, announced the project will shut down because of high transaction costs on the Ethereum network. The cost of adding a new user was recently as high as $130, UniLogin founder <strong>Alex Van de Sande</strong> wrote in a Medium post. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3wel2r5">https://tinyurl.com/y3wel2r5</a></em></li>

          <li><strong>TBTC launched publicly.</strong> The new token provides another option to allow bitcoin to be used in Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) apps. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6opb24x">https://tinyurl.com/y6opb24x</a></em></li>

          <li><strong>Holders of MakerDAO's governance token (MKR) voted</strong> not to compensate users affected by March's "flash crash" of the popular DeFi platform. The move reversed an initial decision in April to issue refunds related to the incident, which cost investors more than $8 million. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2z26wzq">https://tinyurl.com/y2z26wzq</a></em></li>

          <li>The <strong>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</strong>, a key regulator in the U.S., said that federally chartered banks can hold reserve funds for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers. (The Block) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2vwnmfb">https://tinyurl.com/y2vwnmfb</a></em></li>



          <li>Human Rights Foundation CEO <strong>Thor Halvorssen</strong> interviewed Twitter's <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> at the nonprofit's Oslo Freedom Forum event. Their discussion focused on the social network's role as a forum for dissidents but also touched on combating misinformation, increasing decentralization, and other hot topics. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3kf2vzf">https://tinyurl.com/y3kf2vzf</a></em></li>
