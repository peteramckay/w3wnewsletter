      <p><strong>In general, I find there are two big conceptual obstacles that newbies have to clear in understanding blockchain.</strong></p>
      <p>The first is the idea of a crypto token being digital <em>but scarce at the same time</em>. In the internet economy as most people have experienced it until now, there's limitless copying of everything, not scarcity. So the introduction of real scarcity is a pretty fundamental pivot to make, with all sorts of implications for everything we do online and any business we might want to build there.</p>
      <p>The second is the idea that tokens, being programmable, can be used as more than just a form of money. For example, one could build a playable video game with the right token. If your only frame of reference for blockchain is its parallels to the U.S. dollar or euro, it's hard to appreciate such possibilities for software development. No one ever built a video game that runs its code via government-issued currency, after all.</p>
      <p>This is on my mind because of bitcoin's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-20/bitcoin-approaches-19-000-as-true-believers-look-to-record-high">recent run</a> toward a new all-time high -- and thus a fresh round of mainstream news coverage likely to come soon once a new record is set. To the extent bitcoin remains the average person's only reference point to understanding blockchain in general, it strikes me as both a blessing and a curse, really.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, bitcoin is an excellent <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/">example of scarcity</a>, which in turn is why it works well as money. (That's why I own some myself, full disclosure.) But on the other hand, it's by far not the best software development tool, surpassed in that respect by ether and other utility-focused "altcoins."</p>
      <p>So I'd say you're missing out on a lot as a newbie if you don't at least familiarize yourself with the alts as well. The idea of transforming how the internet works through a powerful new development platform is pretty cool, after all. üòâ</p>
      <p>On to the latest headlines:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Buying among big firms and the uber-wealthy is helping to drive bitcoin toward $20,000 for the first time.</strong> The trend represents a marked change since the last all-time high set in 2017, driven mostly by enthusiasts investing smaller sums. <strong>Ricardo Pliego</strong>, the second-richest person in Mexico, tweeted that bitcoin now comprises 10% of his portfolio. (<em>See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4y8psj3">https://tinyurl.com/y4y8psj3</a></em>) In a YouTube interview, <strong>Coinbase</strong>'s head of institutional sales said the exchange has seen a $14 billion increase in institutional assets under custody since April. (See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3cylhmc">https://tinyurl.com/y3cylhmc</a></em>) And <strong>Grayscale Investments</strong> said it has passed $10 billion in assets under management, more than three-quarters of it allocated to bitcoin. (<em>See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y36zrc8e">https://tinyurl.com/y36zrc8e</a></em>)</li>


        <li><strong>The Ethereum 2.0 research team did an AMA session on Reddit</strong> to keep developers and users updated on the forthcoming release. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4th7uan">https://tinyurl.com/y4th7uan</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Washington saw some early reshuffling of senior market regulators.</strong> Securities and Exchange Commission head <strong>Jay Clayton</strong>, a Trump appointee who often took a skeptical view of crypto listings, resigned ahead of his term's scheduled end in June 2021. (<em>See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6h5ouhl">https://tinyurl.com/y6h5ouhl</a></em>) Separately, the president nominated acting Comptroller of the Currency <strong>Brian Brooks</strong>, an advocate for crypto-friendly banking reforms, to fill his current position on a permanent basis. (<em>See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3zgfcz6">https://tinyurl.com/y3zgfcz6</a></em>)</li>


        <li><strong>Vietnam's education ministry is adopting blockchain-based recordkeeping.</strong> The agency has signed an xclusive agreement with Singapore-based smart contract platform <strong>TomoChain</strong> to archive student records on a blockchain, TomoChain announced Wednesday. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5zs8w8l">https://tinyurl.com/y5zs8w8l</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Facing increasing antitrust scrutiny, Google is rolling back a handy perk for news publishers on mobile devices.</strong> Four years after offering special placement in a ‚Äútop stories carousel‚Äù in search results to entice publishers to use a format it created for mobile pages, called AMP, Google announced that it will end that preferential treatment in the spring. The move seems aimed at eliminating any perception among regulators that Google manipulates search results unfairly. However, it ironically hurts some of the businesses already harmed the most by Google's dominance of online advertising. (The Markup) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3jr5lsh">https://tinyurl.com/y3jr5lsh</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Finally, some great tips here from Fast Company about staying motivated for work during the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong> It's not just you; a LOT of people are struggling with this issue right now. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yy9p9vol">https://tinyurl.com/yy9p9vol</a></em></li>
