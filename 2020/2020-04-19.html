    <h1>Web 3.0 Weekly</h1>
    <h4>April 12-18, 2020</h4>
  </span>

  <p>Seems everybody is printing money this week.</p>
  <p>In the private sector, the Facebook-led <strong>Libra Association</strong> released a <a href="https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/#cover-letter">new version of its whitepaper</a> detailing plans for a more traditional payment network integrating multiple existing national currencies alongside the system's native crypto token, the Libra.</p>
  <p>The move away from the group's original Libra-only plan was immediately characterized as either an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/technology/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency.html">an abject retreat</a> or an <a href="https://twitter.com/mpmcsweeney/status/1250795149455691778">even bolder challenge</a> to traditional central banks, depending on whose telling of the story you followed.</p>
  <p>My hunch is the truth lies somewhere inbetween, frankly.</p>
  <p>To understand why, it's important to first realize that every crypto project essentially boils down to three parts ― the token, the network it changes hands on, and the wallets where individual users store their tokens.</p>
  <p>This new Libra plan definitely makes their token less important, but the network piece probably just became <em>more</em> important than ever, both to the Libra Association's members and to two billion potential end users thanks to its likely integration with Facebook.</p>
  <p>Because of the global coronavirus crisis, we're seeing everyday that a more modern network is exactly what's needed in many places around the world, if only for its convenience to everyone getting government payments, benefits, or trying to maintain or re-start a business. If a new network to facilitate such transfers could be made available, easy to use, and fast, would it really matter at this point what its native means of exchange (the token) is? People are growing desperate.</p>
  <p>We can see this clearly on the government side of things, where there's continued interest in issuing official cryptocurrencies. In the U.S., a plan to create a "digital dollar" was taken out of the initial stimulus package that passed Congress recently. But the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/digital-dollar-reintroduced-by-us-lawmakers-in-latest-stimulus-bill">idea has now been revived</a> in a House bill proposing a new round of stimulus, so we'll see if it makes it through this time.</p>
  <p>The advocates of a "digital dollar" are almost entirely focused on the benefits of <em>a better network</em>, especially as we've seen delays in getting stimulus payments to individual citizens and small businesses. Uncle Sam effectively has his own "token" already ― the good ol' U.S. greenback ― but what he lacks is a modern way to distribute it directly to people.</p>
  <p>Instead, the government has traditionally used private banks as a de facto network to reach consumers. But that solution is proving to be way <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/04/15/when-will-you-get-your-stimulus-payment-heres-how-to-check/">too clunky</a> under the current, dire circumstances. We need something else, whether it's Libra, another crypto network, or a government-sanctioned one. Take your pick.</p>
  <p>Other news of interest this week:</p>

 <ul>

   <li>A new education initiative dubbed <strong>SheFi</strong> is launching to expand the participation of women in decentralized finance. <a href="https://medium.com/@shefi_org/hello-world-meet-shefi-1f81f01100d8">An initial post</a> to the project's new Medium page on Thursday gave fuller details details on their plains, including links to additional resources. Founder <strong>Maggie Love</strong> also invites anyone with questions to email her directly at maggie[at]shefi.org.</li>

   <li>My friend <strong>Matt Phillips</strong> explained in the <strong>New York Times</strong> how <strong>modern monetary theory</strong>, previously a fringe idea in economics, has effectively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/business/coronavirus-stimulus-money.html">gone into active implementation</a> in the U.S. during the COVID-19 crisis. Back in October, I blogged about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/crypto-vs-mmt-competing-visions-how-money-should-work-peter-mckay/">my own misgivings about MMT</a>, what it is, and how it differs from most crypto people's vision of proper "tokenomics."</li>


  <li>Over on the tech blog <strong>OneZero</strong>, <strong>Chris Stokel-Walker</strong> reports that ad revenue has <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/as-youtube-traffic-soars-youtubers-say-pay-is-plummeting-30dc1ba444db">dried up</a> for many YouTube content creators lately because of the creeping recession, even though viewership is way up.</li>

   <li><strong>Y Combinator</strong> maestro <strong>Paul Graham</strong> tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1251537525145042953">a helpful reminder</a> about why Medium isn't a good replacement for maintaining your own blog.</li>
