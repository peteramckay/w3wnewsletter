      <p><strong>I got a chuckle</strong> from a killer quote by Pantera Capital CEO <strong>Dan Morehead</strong> in <a href="https://medium.com/@PanteraCapital/the-fed-promises-to-double-inflation-buybitcoin-pantera-blockchain-letter-september-2020-e2b204e1320">his latest Medium post</a>, which succinctly argues the <strong>bullish case for bitcoin right now</strong>.</p>

      <p>Like a lot of crypto folks, Morehead favors bitcoin because of its strictly limited supply, contrasted with the U.S. dollar, which is being printed freely as a form of economic stimulus. This practice seems even more certain to continue following the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>'s latest policy meeting, which included an explicit committment to let inflation <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-opinion-fed-inflation-economic-data/">drift higher than usual</a>.</p>

      <p>Morehead writes:</p>

      <p><em>"It’s a brave new world — when central bankers are promising to <strong>increase</strong> inflation. I’m old enough to remember when they used to fight inflation."</em></p>

      <p>So am I, Dan. So am I.</p>

      <p>Perhaps also of interest, he tweeted <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6fo3wz6">a handy table</a> showing that several crypto tokens and gold have <strong>handily outperformed the S&P 500 this year</strong>.</p>

      <p>The week's other headlines:</p>

        <ul>


          <li>The popular yield farming platform <strong>Uniswap</strong> issued a new governance token on Wednesday, using the symbol UNI. Its market capitalization has already jumped to almost $500 million dollars. <em>Link: <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/">https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/</a></em></li>

          <li><strong>Blockchain activity in Africa appears to be gaining momentum.</strong> Reuters correspondents <strong>Alexis Akwagyiram</strong> and <strong>Tom Wilson</strong> report that weak banking systems and local currencies are prompting users in Nigeria and elsewhere to adopt alternatives for payments and other use cases more readily than in many western countries. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5vvhnja">https://tinyurl.com/y5vvhnja</a></em>) In Senegal, singer <strong>Akon</strong> announced he's broken ground on construction of a new $6 billion project dubbed <strong>Akon City</strong> about 60 miles outside the capital Dakar. The singer's plans for the new city include a local economy that heavily integrates <strong>Akoin</strong>, his own branded cryptocurrency built on the <strong>Stellar</strong> blockchain. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxoc2t32">https://tinyurl.com/yxoc2t32</a></em></li>

          <li><strong>ConsenSys</strong> recently unveiled a new <strong>MetaMask</strong> mobile app that not only acts as an Ethereum wallet but also a browser for distributed applications. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yykta7y4">https://tinyurl.com/yykta7y4</a></em></li>

          <li><strong>Coinbase</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Brian Armstrong</strong> published a tweetstorm about his company's struggles with <strong>Apple</strong>'s restrictions on mobile developers who want to publish their software in the behemoth's App Store. Apple is facing a mounting revolt among developers since <strong>Epic Games</strong>, the creator of <strong>Fortnite</strong>, recently accused the device maker of anticompetitive practices. For its part, Apple maintains that its strict vetting of releases in the App Store is a form of quality control conducted on end users' behalf. <em>Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1304489988881440768">https://tinyurl.com/y336bjn7</a></em></li>

          <li>CoinDesk's <strong>Omkar Godbole</strong> reports that new bitcoin wallets are being created at the fastest pace in more than two years, suggesting a wave of new participants entering the market. However, the yardstick is an imperfect one, as existing users sometimes create multiple wallets. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4mfyrjg">https://tinyurl.com/y4mfyrjg</a></em></li>

          <li>The publicly traded tech company <strong>MicroStrategy</strong> announced it would buy an additional $175 million of bitcoin, on top of a recent $250 million round that set a precedent for listed companies using the token as a cash management tool. CEO <strong>Michael Saylor</strong> explained the strategy in a new interview with CoinDesk's <strong>Danny Nelson</strong>. Saylor claims he could envision MicroStrategy holding its bitcoin "for 100 years." <em>Link: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-bitcoin">https://tinyurl.com/y3tvt9le</a></em></li>

          <li>The crypto exchange <strong>Kraken</strong> registered as a bank in <strong>Wyoming</strong>, which has passed crypto-friendly state regulations in hopes of becoming an industry hotbed.  <em>Link: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-crypto-exchange-secures-bank-charter-under-wyoming-law">https://tinyurl.com/y237xyn4</a></em></li>

          <li><strong>Blockchain Capital joined the Libra Association</strong>, a welcome development for the <strong>Facebook</strong>-led consortium. It suffered several departures of big-name partners earlier this year but is nevertheless pressing ahead with plans to launch a new stablecoin. <em>Link: <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/libra-association-adds-blockchain-capital-as-a-new-member/">https://tinyurl.com/y5z5j5c8</a></em></li>

                    <li><strong>Square</strong> announced it will lead formation of the <strong>Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance</strong>. The new body is designed to prevent patent trolling within the blockchain industry by promoting open licensing of technical standards. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yy24mnmu">https://tinyurl.com/yy24mnmu</a></em></li>
