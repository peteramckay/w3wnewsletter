      <p>A busy week for decentralization news, most of it the good sort:</p>

      <ul>


        <li>The <strong>Ethereum Foundation</strong> announced that its "official" public test network for <strong>Ethereum 2.0</strong>, dubbed <strong>Medalla</strong>, is now live. Full launch of ETH 2.0 is tentatively expected by yearâ€™s end. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6oqbc3u">https://tinyurl.com/y6oqbc3u</a></em></li>


        <li>In its latest earnings report, <strong>Square</strong> reported that <strong>bitcoin</strong> trading via its payments app <strong>Cash</strong> jumped to <strong>$875 million</strong> in the second quarter, up sevenfold from the year-ago period. The rapid growth is good for Square but perhaps even better news for bitcoin, which is perpetually in need of user-friendly entry points for non-geeks to participate, writes <strong>Avi Salzman</strong> of Barron's. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5yd97tg">https://tinyurl.com/y5yd97tg</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Tech merger activity is heating up.</strong> Microsoft is in talks to acquire U.S. operations of <strong>TikTok</strong> from <strong>ByteDance</strong>, facing a 45-day deadline from the Trump administration to complete the deal. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yy7fr3wr">https://tinyurl.com/yy7fr3wr</a></em>) <strong>The White House</strong> has accused the popular social app of being used by the Chinese government to spy on Americans -- a charge that TikTok denies. Separately, the private-equity giant <strong>Blackstone Group</strong> announced it will aquire the genealgy site <strong>Ancestry.com</strong> for <strong>$4.7 billion</strong> in a deal that I'm sure will do wonders for user privacy. <strong>#sarcasm</strong> <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y542y5n8">https://tinyurl.com/y542y5n8</a></em>


        <li>The <strong>New York Times</strong> detailed blow-by-blow how a 17-year-old Florida youth pulled off a massive hack of <strong>Twitter</strong>'s administrative controls recently. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2o2tjx4">https://tinyurl.com/y2o2tjx4</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>News sites have been hit hard by the recession, but pockets of media innovation continue.</strong> Fast Company's <strong>Jared Newman</strong> reported on <strong>Logically</strong>, a startup launching a new browser extension and app in the U.S. to beat back the tide of misinformation ahead of the November election. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2pros6w">https://tinyurl.com/y2pros6w</a></em>) Over at Wired, <strong>Gilad Edelman</strong> covered some publishers' surprisngly successful experiments with non-targeted ads -- a pro-privacy approach that should have led to disaster, according to conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley. If the trend grows, it could be a welcome boon for publishers who have had a hard time competing with hyper-targeted ad platforms like <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6rxavpd">https://tinyurl.com/y6rxavpd</a></em>) Separately, <strong>National Public Radio</strong> announced that applications to its summer internship program rose almost tenfold after it made the gig a remote opportunity. The surge is a promising sign for diversity across the industry. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3alyhvt">https://tinyurl.com/y3alyhvt</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Sen. Amy Klobuchar</strong>, D-Minn., took to the Senate floor to advocate wider access to broadband internet in the U.S., including in underserved rural areas. Frankly, little legislative action on this (or anything else tech-related) is likely ahead of the big U.S. election in November. Still, it's always good to see someone in an important position speak out about this problem. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6ynupbg">https://tinyurl.com/y6ynupbg</a></em></li>
