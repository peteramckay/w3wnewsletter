      <p><strong>As we create the next version of the web</strong>, let's make sure it has inclusive decisionmaking and voices from the start, not replicating the current iteration's blind spots.</p>

      <p>I'm looking at you in particular, <strong>Big Tech</strong> companies, with your staggeringly <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y32xm38v">not-diverse</a> workforce. Perhaps if you were to finally address this, your response to hate speech on your platforms would be less <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/weaponized-facebook-fails-protect-civil-rights-audit-says-n1233143">tin-eared</a>?</p>

      <p>This is all on my mind this week in light of the death of congressman and civil rights hero <strong>John Lewis</strong>, who was the last living speaker from 1963's <strong>March on Washington</strong>. (His full remarks from the historic event are viewable online <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycyvzenu">here</a>.)</p>

      <p>Lewis's lifelong fight was ultimately one for democracy itself. In my experience, that's a cause most people in tech also care about in their own way. Now is a great time to re-dedicate ourselves to it in full, starting with an internet that is truly for everyone.</p>

      <p>On to the latest headlines:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>The Defiant's <strong>Camila Russo</strong> reports that the total market capitalization of <strong>ERC20 tokens</strong> ($33 billion) has topped that of <strong>Ethereum</strong> ($27 billion), which serves as the technical foundation of the ecosystem. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5ber9ug">https://tinyurl.com/y5ber9ug</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Twitter</strong> suffered a massive hack in which prominent accounts like <strong>@barackobama</strong> and <strong>@elonmusk</strong> encouraged users to send bitcoin to an address controlled by the attacker. The hack, which apparently targeted Twitter's in-house admin controls for the entire network, underscores the need for a truly user-owned internet, writes venture investor <strong>Nic Carter</strong>. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycslyb6y">https://tinyurl.com/ycslyb6y</a></em></li>

        <li>The <strong>Mozilla Foundation</strong> has launched a petition urging <strong>Amazon</strong> to include its <strong>Ring</strong> doorbell unit in a recently announced moratorium on providing facial recognition technology to law enforcement. Such software a poor track record identifying people of color -- an increasing concern amid recent controversey over racist policing practices in the U.S. However, Ring continues to share its footage with police through its <strong>Neighbors Law Enforcement Portal</strong>, which the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> has called the "perfect storm of privacy threats." <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y98acano">https://tinyurl.com/y98acano</a></em></li>

        <li>The Block's <strong>Yogita Khatri</strong> reports that <strong>PayPal</strong> revealed in a letter to European regulators in March that the company is working to add crypto trading features, confirming widespread rumors among users and competitors. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y82qatcp">https://tinyurl.com/y82qatcp</a></em></li>


        <li>The crypto-focused firm <strong>Grayscale Investments</strong> issued a strong second-quarter report, including client inflows above $900 million. Grayscale says it now has $4 billion in assets under management, including almost $2 billion of new investment in the last 12 months. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4mf24v2">https://tinyurl.com/y4mf24v2</a></em></li>


       <li>Forbes magazine's <strong>Rory Murray</strong> profiled <strong>Amiti Uttarwar</strong>, who is believed to be the first woman to become a core developer for the Bitcoin network. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9pq7upm">https://tinyurl.com/y9pq7upm</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Coinbase</strong> has scheduled its first-ever investor day for Aug. 14 amid rumors that the crypto exchange is exploring a public stock listing. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7mr72o7">https://tinyurl.com/y7mr72o7</a></em></li>


       <li>A recent enforcement action against <strong>Augur</strong> may signal that U.S. regulators are increasingly skeptical of decentralized finance tools in general, says crypto entrepreneur <strong>Maya Zehavi</strong>. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4sg47h4">https://tinyurl.com/y4sg47h4</a></em></li>


       <li>The Verge's <strong>Sarah Jeong</strong> weighed in on how social media has adversely affected public discourse. The technology's biggest pitfall hasn't been the spread of left-leaning "cancel culture," but rather a muddying of who's credible and who's not, Jeong says. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycnp5qzj">https://tinyurl.com/ycnp5qzj</a></em></li>


       <li><strong>Finally, some handy astronomy news:</strong> Scientists now suspect that if you put a giant black hole at the center of a system, it acts like a parasite, sucking up necessary materials to create new stars. Then the whole system dies. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yyn5vmo6">https://tinyurl.com/yyn5vmo6</a></em></li>
