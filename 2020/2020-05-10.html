    <h1>Web 3.0 Weekly</h1>
    <h4>May 3-9, 2020</h4>
  </span>

  <p>Blockchain. Big Tech platforms. Privacy mistakes you're probably making all on your own. We've really got a little bit of everything to cover this time:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>BitMEX</strong> published an independent analysis of the expected release of <strong>Ethereum 2.0</strong> this summer. The exchange writes in part: "It seems reasonably likely that something will go wrong and that there will be significant further delays. However, despite all these potential issues, Ethereum 2.0 is still probably still worth a try. If this does succeed, the potential rewards are considerable." <em>Link: <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/ethereum-2-0/">https://tinyurl.com/yc8d72tp</a></em></li>


    <li>Ahead of the <strong>Consensys: Distributed</strong> conference starting on Monday, <strong>CoinDesk</strong> is publishing its annual list of the 50 "most innovative, consequential and viable" blockchain projects. A subjective affair, obviously, but definitely good food for thought. <strong>Binance</strong> topped the <strong>CoinDesk 50</strong> list this year, followed by <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Fidelity</strong>'s efforts to merge traditional finance with crypto. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yawexoa6">https://tinyurl.com/yawexoa6</a></em></li>

    <li>CryptoGlobe's <strong>Francisco Memoria</strong> reports that most users of the pro-privacy browser <strong>Brave</strong> aren't using its cryptocurrency features. During a livestreamed conversation with Binance CEO <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong>, Brave CEO <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> said his company's browser had 13.8 million monthly active users as of the end of April, but only 1.7 million of them (about 12 percent) were using its program to reward users with <strong>Basic Attention Token</strong> for looking at web ads. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y8nprzsv">https://tinyurl.com/y8nprzsv</a></em></li>

    <li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>'s price has been volatile ahead of the network <strong>"halvening"</strong> expected on Tuesday. If you're wondering what the fuss is all about, The Next Web's <strong>David Canellis</strong> wrote a handy explainer about the "halvening", which is a periodic reduction in rewards for mining new bitcoins. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yb3ndtvz">https://tinyurl.com/yb3ndtvz</a></em></li>

    <li>As part of its quarterly results, <strong>Square</strong> reported that bitcoin <strong>revenue</strong> from its payments app <strong>Cash</strong> hit $306 million in the first three months of 2020, up 367 percent over the year-ago period. Yowza. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y9pscn4r">https://tinyurl.com/y9pscn4r</a></em></li>

    <li>The Facebook-led <strong>Libra Association</strong> appointed <strong>Stuart Levey</strong>, the current chief legal officer at HSBC, as its first <strong>chief executive officer</strong> on Wednesday. (Reuters) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yb6b7hnl">https://tinyurl.com/yb6b7hnl</a></em></li>

    <li>Separately, <strong>Facebook</strong> appointed a new content board to act as an independent "Supreme Court" to resolve disputes over social posts that violate community standards. (Official site: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ybk4j9p8">https://tinyurl.com/ybk4j9p8</a>) The effort immediately drew a skeptical response from longtime critics, however. Veteran tech journalist <strong>Kara Swisher</strong> said the new board includes no one who's truly suffered from abusive behavior on Facebook, such as parents of Sandy Hook shooting victims, who were harassed by conspiracy theorists on Facebook. <strong>Matt Stoller</strong>, research director at the <strong>American Economic Liberties Project</strong>, said the new board does nothing to address Facebook's monopolistic power in social networking -- the true root of its tolerance of online abuse. AELP has previously published a detailed report on the competitive issues surrounding both Facebook and Google at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ycszsmso">https://tinyurl.com/ycszsmso</a> </li>


    <li>A new survey by <strong>LastPass</strong> confirms what any office IT person worth their salt already suspected: <strong>Too many users are still reusing the same passwords</strong> across multiple sites, which aids memorization but severely compromises security. Stop doing that, folks. Seriously. (Fast Company) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7fjecn6">https://tinyurl.com/y7fjecn6</a></em></li>


    <li>Most <strong>U.S. colleges</strong> are being cagey for now about possible re-openings in the fall, when coronavirus cases may be on the wane but at risk of a resurgence. Princeton University President <strong>Christopher L. Eisgruber</strong> offered a telling (if perhaps inadvertent) glimpse into the dilemma in his latest update to that Ivy League campus. Eisgruber said Princeton will make a final decision about reopening in July. But he also noted that the school is "asking faculty members to begin planning now under the assumption that their classes will be online in the fall." <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y82zte9g">https://tinyurl.com/y82zte9g</a></em></li>
