    <h1>Web 3.0 Week in Review</h1>
    <h4>Feb. 23-29, 2020</h4>
  </span>

  <p>I never expected to write or say aloud the following three words, but here goes:</p>
  <p>Thanks to coronavirus, we just saw one of the clearest tests to date of bitcoin's rep as "digital gold." It failed.</p>
  <p>The "digital gold" thesis holds that bitcoin should be a safe-haven asset at times of crisis, especially any turbulence involving traditional forms of finance. As an alternative asset, bitcoin should benefit when old-school paper investments and currencies are failing, the theory goes. This is similar to the case usually made for "gold gold."</p>
  <p>Well, we just saw a fast-forward version of such a crisis: The S&P 500, a benchmark of the U.S. stock market, slid more than 11 percent last week due to fears that coronavirus would affect global trade.</p>
  <p>And how did bitcoin fare through this ordeal? It was down 11 percent, almost exactly the same as stocks. (It also notably underperformed "gold gold," which had a relatively muted decline of less than 4 percent.)</p>
  <p>For me, the upshot here is that bitcoin (and the crypto market in general) is essentially still speculative in character. When people are in "risk off" mode in their portfolios, as the expression goes on Wall Street, this stuff falls just like everything else.</p>
  <p>In partial defense of bitcoin, it has performed well over the longer term. Year to date in 2020, it's still up 20 percent, which handily beats both the S&P (down 9 percent) and gold (up 4 percent).</p>
  <p>But that just sort of proves my earlier point about the lack of real safe-haven correlation. You can't claim to be a safe haven over a period of months but then fail when the closest thing we have to a zombie apocalypse actually hits. Better to chalk the gains up to speculation and say bitcoin really plays no safe haven role, at least not for now. </p>
  <p>Some disclaimers are in order: I do own some bitcoin. Also, I don't intend any of the above as personal investment advice to the reader; it's just offered purely as news commentary.</p>
  <p>I'd even go a step further and say currency use cases like bitcoin aren't what interests me the most about blockchain, to be frank. I'm much more curious about its potential as a platform to deliver software functionality, which is the true spirit of Web 3.0 that I want the newsletter to focus on.</p>
  <p>That said, the reality is that currencies are over two-thirds of the crypto market, and the price action is on everyone's mind right now in particular. May as well acknowledge those facts and keep it moving, as the kids say.</p>
  <p>On to the week's other headlines:</p>



 <ul>

   <li>Ex-Google CEO <strong>Eric Schmidt</strong> warned in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/eric-schmidt-ai-china.html">a New York Times op-ed</a> that Americans have perhaps <strong>"put too much faith in the private sector to ensure U.S. global leadership in new technology."</strong> Instead, the country needs better public-private partnership to keep up with China in artificial intelligence and other key areas, Schmidt says.</li>

   <li><strong>The convergence of fiat and crypto payments continues.</strong> Square's fourth-quarter financial results showed that close to half the revenue from its Cash App <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drove-half-of-squares-cash-app-revenue-in-the-4th-quarter">came from bitcoin transactions</a>. Meanwhile, <strong>Moneygram</strong> reported that it has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moneygram-got-another-11m-ripple-214029843.html">received over $11 million</a> from <strong>Ripple</strong> over the past two quarters.</li>

   <li><strong>Haseeb Qureshi</strong> of <strong>Dragonfly Research</strong> offered some suggestions about <a href="https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/flash-loans-why-flash-attacks-will-be-the-new-normal-5144e23ac75a">how decentralized finannce can adapt</a> to the "new normal" of flash loans like the controversial ones that recently allowed traders to rack up big profits in seconds while effectively taking no market risk.</li>

   <li>ICYMI: <strong>PBS Frontline</strong> recently dedicated an excellent <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVVfJVj5z8s">two-hour episode</a> to <strong>Amazon</strong>, including a great overview of its history and discussion of whether it is becoming a monopoly. The company's original chief technology officer told producers that it <strong>"may be time" to consider a breakup.</strong></li>


   <li>The <strong>Knight Foundation</strong> held its annual media forum to discuss the intersection of journalism and technology. Full video of the sessions is available <a href="https://vimeo.com/showcase/6818444">here</a>. Separately, the <strong>Verge</strong> warned fellow organizations <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21156681/abc-washington-post-online-trolls-reporters-policy-suspension">not to be tricked</a> by trolls attacking their reporters, who deserve better defense than they've sometimes gotten lately from their employers.</li>

   <li>Finally, amid all the coronavirus news lately, you may not have heard that China is also facing <strong>massive swarms of locusts</strong> along its border with Pakistan. Not to worry, though. They're <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51658145?ocid=socialflow_twitter">deploying an army of ducks</a> to eat the locusts. So it should all be fine.</li>

  </ul>
