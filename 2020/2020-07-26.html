      <p>Important developments this time regarding both Big Tech and the upstarts against it:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>The chief executives of <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, and <strong>Google</strong> are scheduled to testify Wednesday before a U.S. House subcommittee on antitrust issues. The hearing is also likely feature questions on hateful content and allegations of anti-conservative bias on tech platforms, although there has been scant hard evidence of the latter. (The Hill) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6fsjulp">https://tinyurl.com/y6fsjulp</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Federal regulators</strong> said they will allow banks to offer <strong>crypto custody in the U.S.</strong>. The decision effectively opens participation in crypto markets to a much wider audience in America. (CoinTelegraph) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y563g2vh">https://tinyurl.com/y563g2vh</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>America's major credit-card companies continued their embrace of crypto.</strong> In a new blog post, <strong>Visa</strong> offered further details of its plans around <strong>bitcoin</strong> and other tokens. (</em>See the text at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2tvcz9b">https://tinyurl.com/y2tvcz9b</a></em>) Meanwhile, <strong>Mastercard</strong> expanded its cryptocurrency program to make it easier for companies in the space to issue their own payment cards. London-based <strong>Wirex</strong> became the first to take advantage of the change. (CNBC) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3zhyr68">https://tinyurl.com/y3zhyr68</a></em></li>

        <li>CoinDesk's <strong>David Pan</strong> reports that China's state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) has integrated with six public chains -- <strong>Ethereum</strong>, <strong>EOS</strong>, <strong>Tezos</strong>, <strong>NEO</strong>, <strong>Nervos</strong>, and <strong>IRISnet</strong>. The move advances China's goal to be the world's number-one provider of blockchain infrastructure. It may also signal easy integration down the line among the six public chains and China's official national cryptocurrency, which is in early-stage testing. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5cvu9cd">https://tinyurl.com/y5cvu9cd</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>South Korea</strong> finalized a new cryptocurrency income tax of 20 percent. (CoinTelegraph) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y6zmqzz4">https://tinyurl.com/y6zmqzz4</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>New security concerns surfaced about Ethereum.</strong> In a new "economic review" whitepaper, <strong>Tanner Hoban</strong> and <strong>Tom Borgers</strong> of <strong>Consensys</strong> said malicious attacks may scale more easily after the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 update due to the system's reliance on fewer validators. (<em>Full paper is available at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxctqagj">https://tinyurl.com/yxctqagj</a></em>) Separately, Ethereum founder <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> said he's concerned that the rise in fees versus miner revenues on the current network may be introducing new vulnerabilities. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5zv7fr9">https://tinyurl.com/y5zv7fr9</a></em></li>

        <li>Variety's <strong>Michael Schneider</strong> and <strong>Kate Aurthur</strong> reported that Hollywood is quietly killing cable through a strategy of purposeful neglect in lieu of streaming platforms. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y39dt7mt">https://tinyurl.com/y39dt7mt</a></em></li>

        <li>The Wall Street Journal's <strong>Suzanne Vranica</strong> reports that <strong>Disney</strong> has cut its advertising spend on <strong>Facebook</strong>, effectively joining a growing corporate boycott of the platform due to its lax policing of hate speech. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y23ayee4">https://tinyurl.com/y23ayee4</a></em> (Paywall)</li>

        <li>Writing for the MIT Technology Review, <strong>Abby Ohlheiser</strong> says it may be too late for social platforms to stop the <strong>QAnon</strong> conspiracy theory with measures such as fact checks and account suspensions. She says any effective solution must also include an offline component in which friends and family of QAnon adherents are trained to recognize and de-program their loved ones from what amounts to a cult. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3or94a3">https://tinyurl.com/y3or94a3</a></em></li>
