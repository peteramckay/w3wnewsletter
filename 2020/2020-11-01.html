      <p><strong>In honor of the great Sean Connery's passing yesterday,</strong> as well as the fact that one of my quarantined-all-the-time diversions this year has been to watch all the James Bond movies in order, a bit of tech trivia to share:</p>

      <p>Connery's second Bond film, <strong>From Russia With Love</strong>, revolves around 007's efforts to obtain a cipher device called a <strong>Lektor</strong> that can decode Soviet communications. While the Lektor was <a href="https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Lektor/Spektor">fictional</a>, it clearly resembled early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">real-life encryption devices</a> used in the first half of the twentieth century. The movie goes into some detail explaining what the device is, what it does, and even some encryption basics.</p>

      <p>Thus I'm pretty sure that From Russia With Love, released in 1963, contained the first plain-English discussion of encryption anywhere in popular entertainment. Yes, the story is more than a little silly. (Did I mention the Lektor starts out in possession of a hot blonde from whom Bond must entice it? Because of course.) But it's also true that a gazillion whitepapers can't raise as much awareness of new technology among the masses as references like this in a big-budget movie.</p>

      <p>So thank you, Bond. A job well done, as ever. And <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIPSeanConnery?src=hashtag_click">#RIPSeanConnery</a>.</p>

      <p>On to the latest headlines:</p>

      <ul>


        <li><strong>A terrible week for Wall Street was a boon for crypto.</strong> Stocks had their worst week since March, when the COVID crisis first took hold in the U.S. But unlike that earlier episode, crypto moved in the opposite direction, with bitcoin in particular showing strength as a safe haven. The weekly divergence also sets the stage for what could be a dramatic year-end scorecard for 2020. With two months to go, the S&P 500 is now up just 1.2% for the year. By contrast, ether has leapt 198%, bitcoin is up 90%, and gold is up 23%.</li>


        <li><strong>Coinbase is bringing its Visa debit card to America.</strong> The exchange announced that U.S. customers can now join a waitlist for its Coinbase Card, which allows customers to spend cryptocurrency anywhere Visa is accepted. Previously, the card was only available in Europe. (The Verge) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxwrthbk">https://tinyurl.com/yxwrthbk</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>The crypto bank Silvergate reported solid third-quarter earnings, driven by $36 billion in transfers over its payments network.</strong> The total surpassed the activity for all of 2019. (The Block) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxkca4k6">https://tinyurl.com/yxkca4k6</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>It seems J.P. Morgan ‚ù§Ô∏è crypto now.</strong> CNBC reported that the company's own token, dubbed JPM Coin, recently went into use among its corporate clients. (<em>See CNBC's coverage at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxch236w">https://tinyurl.com/yxch236w</a> </em>) Separately, the bank's analysts issued a report predicting that bitcoin's price could triple as it overtakes gold as a hedge against economic turmoil. (<em>See <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4fqsg2d">https://tinyurl.com/y4fqsg2d</a></em>) All of this represents quite a philosophical turnaround for the bank, whose CEO called bitcoin "a fraud" in 2017.</li>

        <li><strong>Californians will vote Tuesday on a proposal to update the state's online privacy law.</strong> The state's Proposition 24 is meant to close certain loopholes. But it‚Äôs also more business-friendly than consumer advocates like, writes <strong>Ruth Reader</strong> of Fast Company. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y44vyywv">https://tinyurl.com/y44vyywv</a></em></li>

        <li>Forbes writer <strong>Michael del Castillo</strong> says he's obtained a leaked document showing that the crypto exchange <strong>Binance</strong> used an elaborate corporate structure to evade U.S. regulators. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y684yfhl">https://tinyurl.com/y684yfhl</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>The week included two big anniversaries in internet history.</strong> On Oct. 29, 1969, computer science professor <strong>Len Kleinrock</strong> sent the first message on <strong>ARPANET</strong>, a network of computers that would evolve to become the public internet we all know and love today. On Oct. 31, 2008, a person or persons writing under the pseudonym <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> published the whitepaper documenting bitcoin's architecture, thus marking the Big Bang of the blockchain era.</li>
