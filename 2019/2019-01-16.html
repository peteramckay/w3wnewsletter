    <h1>Help Indizr grow in 2019!</h1>
    <p>Today I'm launching Indizr's first <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/indizr-a-voice-for-web-30&amp;rcid=r01-154759549154-8e6736d950ca4f20&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w">crowdfunding campaign</a>, to help it grow in the New Year as a voice for <strong>Web 3.0</strong>. Please<strong> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/indizr-a-voice-for-web-30&amp;rcid=r01-154759549154-8e6736d950ca4f20&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w">donate today</a> </strong>via <strong>GoFundMe</strong> to help us spread the word about a more decentralized vision of the internet. </p>
    <p>As I've said before, my loose definition of "Web 3.0", which is still a pretty new term in the tech industry, is that it encompasses anything that helps to decentralize digital services and information.</p>
    <p>In other words, Web 3.0 tech works 180 degrees the opposite of what most of us experience on the internet these days -- centralization run amok, with just a few big platforms like <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> dominating our digital lives. </p>
    <p><strong>It doesn't have to be this way.</strong> The hottest technology right now that supports decentralization -- and the one whose community has most aggressively embraced the term Web 3.0 -- is the <a href="https://blog.indizr.com/blockchain-basics/">blockchain</a> . But I would say other things might also still plausibly be included under the Web 3.0 umbrella at this verrrrrry early stage. Stuff like semantic HTML, which has notably been promoted by worldwide web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee via his open-source project <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a>  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his startup Inrupt. I'd say the open <a href="https://blog.indizr.com/linux-is-my-ecosystem/">Linux</a>  operating system is also very Web 3.0 at its heart. And there's other stuff out there as well.</p>
    <p>I've been writing about these topics and more for a little over a year here on Indizr, which I started as a personal passion project. But I'd like to devote more time to building it into something bigger in 2019, in light of the growing public interest these times around the harm caused by Big Tech platforms.</p>
    <p>Won't you please help Indizr grow by<strong> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/indizr-a-voice-for-web-30&amp;rcid=r01-154759549154-8e6736d950ca4f20&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w">making a donation</a></strong>? Your support will help enable me to spend more time on both the Indizr <a href="https://blog.indizr.com">website</a> and this expanded newsletter versus other freelancing or consulting gigs to pay bills this year. That's really the biggest obstacle I have to growing the site right now -- time demands.</p>
    <p>As I think most readers know, I'm a former award-winning reporter at the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and Vice. I developed an interest in Web 3.0 through my experience seeing news organizations fall prey to an increasingly concentrated oligarchy of Big Tech companies that.</p>
    <p>I left the Journal in 2010 to co-found and lead product development for Roscoe Labs, which focused on mobile news video. That startup ultimately didn't work out, but I've been on a more entrepreneurial path ever since, with most of my contract work these days focused on marketing for blockchain startups.</p>
    <p>On the Indizr blog and newsletter, it's my policy not to write about clients, and to fully disclose any other formal relationships I may have with any names that may be mentioned. In other words, I try to provide high-quality, reliable content on Indizr, consistent with the standards I've met over the years at much larger news organizations.</p>
    <p>I hope you'll<strong> <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/indizr-a-voice-for-web-30&amp;rcid=r01-154759549154-8e6736d950ca4f20&amp;pc=ot_co_campmgmt_w">support Indizr's growth in 2019</a></strong>. I appreciate your donations to help this little project reach a wider audience. Thanks!</p>
