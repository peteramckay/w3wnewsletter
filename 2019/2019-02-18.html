    <h1>Tokenizing Indizr</h1>
    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1530037768512-3c9a22715452" alt="photo-1530037768512-3c9a22715452">
    <p>It's important to me not just to talk about Web 3.0
    but to "walk the walk" as well by  implementing decentralized technology as
    much as possible to publish content. </p>
    <p>In that spirit, Indizr has now become one of the more than 26,000 verified publishers in the Brave ecosystem, which aims to remake the broken business model for ad-supported digital media. </p>
    <p>Brave makes a web browser that's
    based on the same code as Google Chrome but carries some distinct
    features. The Brave browser blocks ads and tracking codes by default,
    which gives users greater privacy and faster pageloads as they visit
    their favorite sites. It also uses a novel cryptocurrency, the Basic
    Attention Token, to pay verified publishers like Indizr in small
    increments as users view the publishers' content in the Brave browser.</p>
    <p>(Unfortunately, this doesn't help Indizr monetize distribution channels like this email newsletter yet, just web traffic for now. But who knows, maybe they'll add email tools later.)</p>

    <p>Brave is doing some pretty radical stuff here, to say the
    least. For fuller detail, including some discussion of features that are
    in the works for future Brave releases, check out this <a href="https://vimeo.com/209336437">3-minute intro video</a> by their CEO Brendan Eich.</p>

    <p>Brave says it's gotten more than 5 million users so far â€“ a drop in the
    bucket compared to the likes of Chrome but nonetheless a promising
    foothold to hopefully build upon.</p>
    <p>If you're not a Brave user yet, you can download the desktop version of their browser via a <a href="https://brave.com/ind110">custom referral link</a> Brave has created for Indizr as a verified publisher. Indizr will get some BAT tokens if you <a href="https://brave.com/ind110">download the Brave browser</a> and use it consistently for at least 30 days.</p>
    <p>That's
    probably a good idea anyway, just for your own sake as a user, as Brave
    is faster and more respectful of your privacy than the most popular
    alternatives. So this is potentially a win-win-win situation for
    everyone.     <em>- Peter A. McKay</em> </p>
