  <h1>Week in Review: Dec. 8-14, 2019</h1>

  <p>I got a good laugh this week out of <a href="https://twitter.com/Rhythmtrader/status/1204378874865426434">an anti-electricity cartoon</a> from 1889 tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Rhythmtrader/">@Rhythmtrader</a>, who usually focuses on crypto markets. The subtext, of course, is that new technology is always scary to some people, in part because we're just hard-wired to resist change of any kind. </p>
  <p>It seems quaint now that anyone would run fleeing for his life from electricity, amid bodies of people it's killed in the street, as the cartoon depicts. We just take electricity for granted as a daily necessity in 2019. But in 1889, some people who had only ever seen gaslights and candles in their lifetimes really did have life-and-death fears of... electric streetlights?</p>
  <p>On several occasions lately, I've spoken to folks with what I'd say are similar fears of blockchain. Chalk these conversations up as a side effect of the holiday season, spending time around a lot of non-geek relatives and friends who don't deal with this stuff all the time.</p>
  <p>"Blockchain? What, like bitcoin? Sounds risky!"</p>
  <p>"It'll never work! Count me out!"</p>
  <p>No question, there are certain risks associated with this new technology. [Insert boilerplate warning not to take anything said here as investing advice. Do your own research. Yadda yadda yadda.]</p>
  <p>At the same time, I also try to put the risks of any new technology, including blockchain, in the most rational, least emotional context possible. In particular, I find one reality-check question is useful whenever told something is risky:</p>
  <p>Compared to what?</p>
  <p>As a reporter at the Wall Street Journal, I covered the historic market meltdown of 2008 and its aftermath. To this day, my favorite factoid that encapsulates the awfulness of the crisis is this:</p>
  <p>For the first time in recorded history, over the course of a full year, <em>the combined gross domestic product of all the countries on earth <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?end=2018&start=1961&view=chart">went down</a></em> in 2009. In other words, the total value of all goods and services produced by all humankind under the sun that year was erased by a meltdown essentially caused by big U.S. banks. The numbers show it in black and white.</p>
  <p>Wall Streeters tend to get pretty testy when people frame the crisis like that, by the way. We can certainly go into mind-numbing detail about the crisis, with some individuals and organizations coming off better than others. But the jist of it still boils down to this: The banks created what Warren Buffett famously <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/04/the-value-of-financial-weapons-of-mass-destruction-is-plunging.html">called</a> "financial weapons of mass destruction." And then those weapons detonated. That's it.</p>
  <p>Which brings us back to blockchain, especially the currency use cases that most newbies ask about. When you tell me in 2019 that crypto is "risky," is it more so than everything I just described about traditional banking? Really?</p>
  <p>Along similar lines: When you tell me self-driving cars sound "dangerous"... Compared to what? <em>People</em>-driven cars? Especially ones driven by <em>other</em> people? Because <em>you're</em> an impeccable driver, of course.</p>
  <p>But that's a whole other story.</p>
  <p>On to the latest Web 3.0 news:</p>

 <ul>

   <li><strong>The Merkle</strong> <a href="https://themerkle.com/pboc-officials-confirm-its-digital-currency-has-major-telecom-support/">reports</a> that the new national cryptocurrency from the <strong>People's Bank of China</strong> will be tested soon in Suzhou and Shenzhen in partnership with seven state-owned firms, including four commercial banks and three of China's largest telcom providers. Meanwhile, <strong>Sweden</strong> is also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sweden-prepares-to-pilot-crypto-krona/">working</a> on a crypto version of its national currency, the <strong>krona</strong>.</li>
  <li>Separately, it's presumed Sweden has no plans to replicate China's recent record as <a href="https://reut.rs/2E8zjne">the worst jailer of journalists in the world</a>. <strong>China imprisoned at least 48 journalists in 2019</strong>, more than any other country, according to a new report by the <strong>Committee to Protect Journalists</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>CoinDesk</strong> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kraken-job-ad-hints-at-plan-to-build-special-purpose-wyoming-bank">reports</a> that the crypto exchange <strong>Kraken</strong> has registered what's known as a special-purpose bank in <strong>Wyoming</strong>, possibly as a workaround to stricter state regulations in <strong>New York</strong> governing customer interactions. The company has also <a href="https://themerkle.com/kraken-enables-chaps-and-uks-faster-payments-service-support/">taken steps in the United Kingdom</a> recently to make trading easier for users there.</li>

   <li>Bitcoinist's <strong>Christina Comben</strong> did a rundown of her <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/what-every-crypto-hodler-wants-for-christmas/">top five crypto Christmas presents</a>. Handy! 🎅🏻</li>


  <li><strong>Telos</strong>, an application-focused network forked from EOS, celebrated the first anniversary of the launch of its mainnet on Dec. 12. I <a href="https://medium.com/telos-foundation/telos-a-place-for-purpose-dea6f79cde5d">blogged about this</a> for the <strong>Telos Foundation</strong>, which launched a new branding campaign, amid other efforts to draw in new users in 2020.</li>

  <li><strong>Lisk</strong>, one of the high flyers in the ICO boom of 2016, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/lisk-lays-off-21-staff-experts-quit/">laid off 21 employees</a> and terminated the contracts of three pending hires amid continued struggles.</li>

  <li><strong>The MIT Technology Review</strong> reports that where U.S. law enforcement sees an encryption problem, spyware companies increasingly <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614898/cops-see-an-encryption-problem-spyware-makers-see-an-opportunity/">see a business opportunity</a> to create workarounds that enable more efficient surveillance of users. </li>

  <li><strong>Bloomberg BusinessWeek</strong> has confirmed what many of us already suspected: Actual humans have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-12-11/silicon-valley-got-millions-to-let-siri-and-alexa-listen-in">listened in on recordings of users</a> captured by voice assistant devices like Alexa more frequently than Silicon Valley lets on. The ostensible purpose is to "train" the artificial intelligence under the hood of these devices.</li>

     <li>Twitter co-founder and CEO <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> announced that the company will <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">fund a five-person team</a> "to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard." Sounds promising.</li>

     <li>On an unhappier note, Twitter shareholder, business professor, and Silicon Valley gadfly <strong>Scott Galloway</strong> thinks @Jack's plan to spend several months living in Africa in 2020 is beyond the pale, especially for a public company whose stock has underperformed its peers for several years running. Galloway wrote <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/twtr-enough-already">an open letter</a> to Twitter Executive Chairman <strong>Omid R. Kordestani</strong> recommending Dorsey be replaced as CEO.</li>

    <li>Finally, RIP to actor <strong>Danny Aiello</strong>. As I thought about his movies after <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/danny-aiello-dead-do-right-thing-moonstruck-actor-was-86-1168765">news of his death</a> broke on Friday, it struck me that he was in possibly the only three movies someone needs to watch to make it through adulthood OK -- The Godfather: Part II, Do the Right Thing, and Moonstruck.</li>

</ul>
