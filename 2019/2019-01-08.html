    <h1>Kick Big Tech out of your digital life in 2019</h1>
    <p>Happy New Year! To start 2019 off with a bang, we already have a bunch of Web 3.0 news to cover from around the web. Here goes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a <a href="https://blog.indizr.com/ways-to-nudge-big-tech-out/">new post</a> on the Indizr blog, I've listed <strong>20 tips</strong> to nudge Big Tech out of your life in 2019. These are all  things that have been on my mind awhile, so I just decided to collect them in one place while everyone's in a mode to make fresh starts. For instance, why not <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">try a new search engine</a> that doesn't track you like a certain one based in <strong>Mountain View</strong> does? </li>
      <li>I've been belatedly catching up via <strong>YouTube</strong> on some of the presentations from the recent <strong>Web3 Summit</strong> in Berlin. One big highlight so far, for several reasons, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l44z35vabvA">this talk</a> by Protocol Labs CEO <strong>Juan Benet</strong> covering the basics of what Web 3.0 is. His remarks focused on blockchain, but I was glad to hear him also shout out <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee's</strong> work on semantic HTML as well as a potential building block of the new web. That broad-based definition is something I've tried to follow on the Indizr blog, so I'm glad to hear independent validation of it </li>
      <li>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNisYrJCU6Q">talk</a> by <strong>Ben Livshits</strong>, chief scientist at <strong>Brave Software</strong>, about the new Brave web browser was also fascinating. The Brave team's vision of using their browser, which includes a built-in crypto wallet, as an "on-ramp" for everyday folks to participate in Web 3.0 is really compelling since mass adoption has been a big problem so far.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ajit Tripathi</strong>, a partner at the Ethereum accelerator <strong>ConsenSys</strong>, is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/r-i-p-icos-2019-will-be-the-year-of-enterprise-blockchain-tokens">predicting</a> a big year for enterprise blockchain tokens that support real use cases, in contrast to the more purely speculative initial coin offerings of the last few years.</li>
        <li>Bloomberg's <strong>Shira Ovide</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiraOvide/status/1080856539169280005">tweeted</a> to point out that <strong>Apple</strong> has lost "a Facebook of market value" recently. To be more specific, Apple's market cap is <strong>down more than $400 billion</strong> since its quarterly earnings report Nov. 1 amid concerns about a potential long-term decline in demand for new iPhones. Seems people are holding onto their devices longer and seeing less reason to upgrade each product cycle as Apple's improvements to the device have become more incremental. Ouch.</li>
        <li>On a much happier note, the <strong>Guardian</strong> recently caught up with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/01/africa-inspired-inventors-royal-academy-of-engineering-prize">some of the finalists</a> for the <strong>Royal Academy of Engineering</strong>'s Africa prize, which provides early-stage funding and mentorship for inventors on the continent. A lot of really cool, inspiring stuff here, including a Kenyan man who created a glove with sensors that translate sign language into text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today!</p>
