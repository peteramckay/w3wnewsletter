  <h1>Week in Review: Nov. 10-16, 2019</h1>


  <p>The latest Web 3.0 news, including Indizr's own content and headlines from elsewhere around the web:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Brave</strong> hit a big milestone with the <a href="https://brave.com/brave-launches-next-generation-browser/">release</a> of version 1.0 of it's pro-privacy web browser. CEO <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1195104731414188032">says</a> the company is nearing 9 million monthly active users and more than 300,000 registered publishers eligible to be compensated in <strong>Basic Attention Token</strong> for their web traffic. (Indizr is proudly among them, of course (C; If you're curious to try the Brave browser, there's an affilate link to download it at the end of this message.)</li>
      <li>New rules <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/makerdaos-multi-collateral-dai-token-is-launching-nov-18">take effect</a> this week for the <strong>MakerDAO</strong> project, which manages the DAI stablecoin. The community is voting on seven new crypto currencies that may become <strong>acceptable collateral to print DAI</strong>. Until now, the process has been ethereum-only. Among the new possibilities being voted on is BAT, which may open up some interesting financing opportunities for content creators and media startups who want to leverage their holdings of that token.</li>
      <li>I had a blast Thursday participating in a <strong>blockchain panel</strong> as part of <strong>Northwestern University</strong>'s entrepreneurship series. Along with <strong>Yvonne Zhang of Hummingbot</strong>, <strong>Tory Reiss of TrustToken</strong>, and moderator <strong>Michelle Wong of Dechert LLP</strong>, we covered a lot of the basics for an audience of mostly NWU alumni at the school's San Francisco campus. Full video is available <a href="https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=bbeb4d30-157c-4be0-bd83-aafe015036e7">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Almost as fun: Mixing it up with a <strong>New York Times</strong> tech reporter and <strong>Facebook</strong>'s head of policy communications <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay/status/1194283355237486592">on Twitter</a> over whether Section 230 of the <strong>Communications Decency Act of 1996</strong> should be repealed. </li>
      <li>Data scientist <strong>Cathy O'Neil</strong> <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">spoke to Slate</a> about the recent controversy over alleged sexism in the algorithmic vetting of credit applicants for the <strong>Apple Card</strong>. O'Neil, author of the excellent <strong>Weapons of Math Destruction</strong>, stopped short of condemning Apple or its partner Goldman Sachs outright based on the available evidence so far. But she added: <em>"The larger point is that it’s unaccountable and opaque, and Apple doesn’t really care. The most important point being that we should demand that they do better than that. We should demand accountability on the part of anybody who’s using an algorithm like that."</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>New York University</strong> finance professor <strong>Thomas Philippon</strong> estimates that the presence of monopolies in various industries <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/13/america-was-once-the-land-of-free-markets-now-theyre-becoming-a-myth">costs the average American</a> about $300 per month. The lack of competition gives the companies in these industries outsized pricing power to squeeze consumers, Philippon says.</li>
      <li>As part of a presentation at a conference in New York, investor <strong>Dovey Wan</strong> listed her <a href="https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1195134703159971843">top five myths about China's crypto market</a>.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finally, a quick housekeeping note:</strong> I've had some web server problems lately with Indizr's blog. Shouldn't really affect anyone who's an email-only reader, except in the limited sense that some old links within recent emails may be broken if you try to click through. Working to resolve ASAP, though. Apologies for any inconvenience while the situation in flux.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today!
