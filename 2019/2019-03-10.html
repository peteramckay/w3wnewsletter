      <h1>
        <a href="">The latest Web 3.0 headlines &amp; links</a>
      </h1>
      <p>We've had a bunch of news around decentralization lately. Some highlights to keep you up to date:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/03/04/whats-brewing-inside-the-starbucks-bakkt-partnership/">report</a> by <strong>The Block</strong> (paywall) has ratcheted up anticipation that <strong>Starbucks</strong> is close to implementing bitcoin payments for customers at its U.S. stores via the <strong>Bakkt</strong>
        platform. One tip-off: The giant coffee chain has received a major
        equity stake in Bakkt despite the fact it's not a cash investor, The
        Block reports.</li>
        <li>The Brave/Basic Attention Token community is
          continuing to hit all sorts of milestones around growth and new product
          features... <strong>Brave</strong> has begun enabling <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/brave-now-can-pay-you-70-percent-of-its-browser-ad-revenue/">payments in BAT</a>
          to users viewing ads that are native to the Brave web browser. So far,
          the feature is enabled in the developer release of the browser only,
          with plans to go into production for everyone soon... Separately, the
          company announced a <a href="https://brave.com/brave-tap-blockchain/">partnership</a> with the <strong>TAP Network</strong> to help users spend their hard-earned tokens with brands like <strong>Red Bull</strong> and <strong>Paramount Pictures</strong>... TheVerge's <strong>Vlad Savov </strong>has been using Brave and<strong> </strong>has now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18249623/brave-browser-choice-chrome-vivaldi-replacement-chromium">proclaimed</a> it "the ideal Chrome alternative" in a post that I'm guessing had people doing backflips at Brave hq... <a href="https://givebat.com/"><strong>Givebat</strong></a>, an independently curated directory of Brave-verified publishers, launched on Wednesday... And, oh yeah,<strong> BAT's price has risen 88 percent</strong> since the beginning of February. It recently traded above 21 cents, putting its total market cap at a cool $42 million. </li>
          <li>The journalism blockchain project <strong>Civil</strong> has officially launched its <a href="https://blog.joincivil.com/civil-means-journalism-3fd7a6be8aee">reboot</a> after a busted initial coin offering late last year. </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>'s new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">plan</a> to re-focus <strong>Facebook</strong>
            on private messaging was met with skepticism from pretty much everyone
            around both Silicon Valley and Washington last week. Veteran tech
            bloggers <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/om/status/1103414535128440832">Om Malik</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/03/07/164640.html">Dave Winer</a></strong> both weighed in to say they still view the company as a bad actor. On the political left, Democratic presidential candidate <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> was clearly unimpressed as she <a href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c">took to Medium</a> to unveil her plan to break up Facebook, <strong>Google</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong>. On the right, conservative blogger <strong>Michelle Malkin</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/michellemalkin/status/1103737487036465152">tweeted</a> about tools she's using to phase Big Tech out of her digital life... Yup. That covers just about everyone.</li>
            <li>CNBC's <strong>Carl Quntanilla</strong> shared <a href="https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/1101471313800122369/">some eye-popping charts</a> from <strong>Cowen Research </strong>detailing
              the declines in the count of different types of retail stores in the
              U.S. during the e-commerce era. The number of book stores alone is down
              49 percent since its peak in 2002, of course. But there have also been
              massive drops in stores that sell electronics (down 28 percent),
              clothing (12 percent), and furniture (27 percent) since their respective
              peaks.</li>
              <li>Writing for Barron's, <strong>Greg Satell</strong> <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/blockchains-biggest-opportunities-arent-in-bitcoin-51551191828">says</a>
              the biggest opportunities in blockchain are related to utility, not
              currency speculation in bitcoin. Specifically, Satell is bullish on
              applications that make data more accessible or useful.  </li>
              <li>Twitter user @BamHanson <a href="https://twitter.com/BamHanson/status/1103106736171507712">tweeted</a> a copy of a note that his daughter brought home from her teacher because the child opened <strong>Firefox</strong> on her laptop instead of <strong>Chrome</strong>.
                Not a great day for open source in education. On the bright side,
                several people on the Firefox team replied to @BamHanson's original
                tweet pledging to send his daughter Firefox stickers, a t-shirt, and
                other goodies. Awwww....</li>
                <li>Finally, an off-topic personal update: I've concluded that <strong>LeBron James &gt; Michael Jordan</strong>. Disagree? Please leave your angry tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay/status/1104059255534075905">here</a>. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today, and for your interest in Web 3.0!</p>
