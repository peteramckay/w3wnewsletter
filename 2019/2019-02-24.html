    <h1>Tokenizing Indizr, Part II</h1>
    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524673278499-6c651bf78b14" alt="photo-1524673278499-6c651bf78b14">
    <p>It's no secret, I've been <a href="https://blog.indizr.com/tokenizing-indizr/">pretty excited</a>
    lately about the Basic Attention Token and its potential to create a
    fairer system of compensating content creators on the web. I verified
    Indizr's <a href="https://blog.indizr.com">website</a> with Brave, which makes <a href="https://brave.com/ind110">a snappy web browser</a> that's the hub of the BAT ecosystem, and I've received a small amount of BAT over the last few weeks. Pretty cool stuff. </p>
    <p>That said, BAT isn't the only crypto solution trying to free content from
    the dreaded advertising duopoly of Google and Facebook right now. As
    often happens when you blog –  and thanks to the blockchain
    industry's continued expansion as well – I've been hearing from folks
    working on other content-related tokens ever since I wrote about BAT. In
    the interest of both fairness and encouraging innovation on multiple
    fronts, I want to cover some of the others here briefly as well.</p>
    <p>One I've now signed up for in addition to BAT is <a href="https://tippin.me/">Tippin</a>, which enables one-time tips of bitcoin from consumers to content creators via the Lighning Network and Twitter. I haven't gotten any
    bitcoin out of it yet, to be honest, but Tippin does already seem to
    have some strong points, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A dead simple sign-up process.</li>
      <li>Its integration with a major platform like Twitter that carries a built-in user base of hundreds of millions of people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For
    the moment, those are both weak points for BAT, quite frankly. But the
    Brave team is clearly still hard at work on it, so I'm not going to give
    up on BAT by any stretch. </p>

    <p>The BAT ecosystem also has some unique advantages that Tippin doesn't – for instance, the privacy and performance boosts that the Brave browser gives to end users right out of the box. For creators, BAT and Brave also offer a clearer path to <em>recurring</em> revenue that might ultimately make for a more sustainable business model than one-time tips alone with Tippin. </p>
    <p>For me as the creator of this website, it's just too early to judge between these two products for now. I'm happy to continue to experiment a
    little longer with both and just see what happens. And I'm glad they're
    both out there trying new things, since it's the Death Star-sized
    companies that are the true enemy. You won't find me engaging in any
    nerd fights about which is better.</p>
    <p>(By the way, you can download the Brave Browser for free via Indizr's custom referral link <a href="https://brave.com/ind110">here</a>, if you want to give it a try. Indizr will get some free tokens if you do so, which helps support the site. Or, if you want to tip us some bitcoin via Tippin, our custom page for that platform is <a href="https://tippin.me/@itsindizr">here</a>.) </p>
    <p>Finally, I should also give some shout-outs (and provide links) to two other crypto projects in the publishing space that I <em>haven't</em> tried myself yet. There's <a href="https://civil.co/">Civil</a>, which is structured to be a comprehensive newsroom governance and monetization solution, and <a href="https://agate.one/">Agate</a>,
    which seeks to implement a more flexible system of metered payments for
    content in lieu of traditional paywall-based subscriptions.</p>
    <p>I'm
    summarizing quite a bit with both those descriptions, I'll admit. But
    please do click through the links above if you're curious for more detail.
  </p>
  <p>Frankly, I don't believe the market will settle on just one
  "right" solution for monetizing online content anytime soon. I think
  we'll be in a multi-model world for content for some time to come, with
  some sites supported by ads, some by event ticket sales, some by
  subscriptions, and so on. But what I do think is crystal clear is that
  we need <em>something</em> new to free revenue streams from the near-complete control that tech's Death Stars currently enjoy. </p>
  <p>Getting
  better terms or more benevolent behavior out of those companies won't
  work, despite the frequent focus of the tech press on exactly that.
  Organized, sustained revolt against the Death Stars is the only real
  solution at this point.</p>
  <p>In that spirit, let's have a little fun to
  close this one out. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=Ze2kpOZx_kU">a link</a> to the Rogue One movie trailer from a
  few years back. It contains one of my all-time favorite lines from the
  Star Wars franchise, even though that line didn't make it into the final
  movie. See if you can spot it (C; </p>
