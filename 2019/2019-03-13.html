      <h1>A brief release history of the web</h1>
      <p>As an aficionado of Web 3.0 tech, I realize that putting version
      numbers on the World Wide Web is an inherently arbitrary, somewhat messy
      undertaking. After all, the web isn't corporate-owned software like
      Windows with official release dates, but an open technology with several
      billion users, developers, and other stakeholders shaping it everyday.
      That's the very beauty of it.</p>
      <p>In that spirit, I'm going to run
      through a quick timeline below of the web from birth to version 3.0,
      using just six key dates that I believe defined the (very unofficially)
      numbered stages so far. </p>
      <p>Now is a great time to do this, as the web is celebrating its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/world-wide-web-30-tim-berners-lee-message/">30th anniversary</a>
      this week. Plus, a simple chronology may help clarify for newbies what
      I'm yammering about with all the "Web 3.0" jazz the rest of the time
      around here. </p>
      <p>Here goes: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>March 12, 1989:</strong>
          Tim Berners-Lee, a physics researcher at CERN in Switzerland, launches
          the first web server in order to better share documents with his
          colleagues. To do this, he creates several new software tools, including
          a coding system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language</a> to allow research papers to link directly to previous works cited. This is effectively the Big Bang of the <strong>Web 1.0</strong> era, which is <strong>defined by document sharing</strong>. For over a decade to come, people primarily envision the web as a series of "pages" referring to one another.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>February 1991</strong>:
              America Online ships the first version of its web "portal" software.
              We're still squarely in the Web 1.x era here, but this event bears
              mentioning as a crucial step toward bringing the web to the masses.
              (Maybe we'll call it Web 1.3?) Through the '90s, AOL and its competitors
              Prodigy and CompuServe will connect millions of people to the web for
              the first time, mostly through traditional copper phone lines to their
              homes and offices. </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Aug. 9, 1995:</strong> Netscape
                  Communications, maker of the popular Navigator web browser, completes
                  its initial public offering of stock, making millions for the company's
                  early investors. We're still in the web's early growth stage here –
                  let's call it version 1.6 at this point – but this IPO is another truly
                  seminal event. Widely <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netscape-ipo-ignited-the-boom-taught-some-hard-lessons-20058518550">regarded around Wall Street</a>
                  as the start of the first "dotcom boom," the Netscape IPO validated the
                  web as a viable platform to do business at massive scale. It thus paved
                  the way for other wildly popular tech IPOs to come throughout the 1990s
                  and early 2000s, including Google, Amazon, and so on.</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Aug. 1, 2003:</strong> MySpace launches. This marks the start of <strong>Web 2.0</strong>, defined by people's <strong>use of the web to communicate directly with one another via social networks. </strong>Though
                      it's easy to forget now, this was a pretty radical departure at the
                      time from approaching the web merely as a tool to view relatively inert
                      pages of information. Facebook and other competitors would eventually
                      eclipse MySpace, of course, but history will always have to credit them
                      as the first breakout success of the social era. Also notable: Of all
                      the unofficial web "versions" discussed in this post, the term "Web 2.0"
                      is by far the most popularly known and accepted, as it's been widely
                      used in the press over time as shorthand for all things related to
                      social networking.</li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Nov. 12, 2006:</strong> New York Times tech reporter John Markoff does <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html">a story on Web 3.0</a>
                        – the earliest known reference to the term in a popular, global
                        publication. He mentions a budding movement among technologists toward
                        artificial intelligence and data tools to add semantic meaning to web
                        content.</li>
                        <li>
                          <strong>Oct. 31, 2008:</strong> A mysterious author (or authors) publishes under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto a <a>whitepaper</a>
                          describing the technology behind bitcoin, which soon after goes into
                          production and becomes a global phenomenon. To me, this is <strong>the true start of the Web 3.0 era</strong> – after the proto stage that Markoff ably documented – as bitcoin brings the concept of <strong>decentralization</strong>
                          to the fore in a big way. Unlike previous web technologies, which were
                          built to rely heavily upon distinct servers like the one Berners-Lee ran
                          from his desk at CERN all the way back in 1989, bitcoin uses novel
                          encryption techniques to store transaction data for each bitcoin token <em>on a peer-to-peer network</em>. This eventually opens the way for even more full-fledged distributed computers -- like the Ethereum network created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> – that can run entire applications without the use of traditional servers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Of
                        course, decentralization runs counter to the very nature of the web as
                        most of us currently experience it in 2019, dominated by just a few big
                        services like Facebook and Google that increasingly abuse us. That's why
                        any shift toward decentralization warrants a whole new "version" number
                        for the web.</p>
                        <p>I believe recent technical advances, coupled with
                        rapidly rising skepticism of Big Tech among consumers, suggest the
                        decentralization trend will run on quite awhile longer. That should lead
                        to more user control of our personal data, greater market competition
                        among companies, more innovation, and other benefits.</p>
                        <p>Which isn't
                        to say there won't be more bumps in the road, mind you. There are
                        probably still more privacy scandals to come involving abuse of
                        centrally hosted data – like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/you-may-have-forgotten-foursquare-it-didnt-forget-you/">this story</a> that Wired just broke about Foursquare. </p>
                        <p>But
                        in general, I'm optimistic as the web turns 30. No, its worst actors
                        haven't decisively been defeated yet. But momentum is on the side of the
                        users and upstarts.</p>
