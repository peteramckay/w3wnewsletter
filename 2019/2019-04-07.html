      <h1>Free content (and other goodies)</h1>
      <p>A couple newsy links to pass along today, plus some <strong>crypto freebies</strong>. Because everyone loves freebies . Here goes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a <a href="https://blog.indizr.com/why-we-should-want-the-ad-model-to-survive/">new blog post</a> this week, I wrote that the race to find new business models for digital content is fine. But while we're at it, <strong>let's not completely abandon the old warhorse that is advertising.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jutta Steiner</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Parity Technologies</strong>, has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/juttasteiner/2019/04/03/fighting-the-citadels-that-own-our-data-how-web3-empowers-us-to-take-back-control/#31b79064af8a">a new essay</a> in <strong>Forbes</strong> about how Web 3.0 technologies can help undo the harm of centralized services that abuse users' data.</li>
        <li>The browser startup <strong>Brave</strong> is close to full rollout of a new feature that rewards users with crypto tokens for viewing ads during your everyday web surfing. (The company has announced the feature is currently in late stages of testing.) So now is a great time to get started with the Brave browser, which is similar to Chrome, if you haven't already. You can download it for free via <a href="https://brave.com/ind110">this referral link</a>. (As a bonus, <strong>Indizr</strong>, which publishes this newsletter, will get a few tokens for referring you. So it's an indirect way to support our content.)</li>
        <li>Along similar lines, if you're <strong>new to crypto</strong> and would like to <strong>create an account</strong> to participate in the markets for the first time, I have a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/5bef434765bc0001f19f7328">referral link here</a> to sign up at <strong>Coinbase</strong>. They're one of the most popular crypto exchanges -- and one of the most user-friendly.</li>
        <li>As a Coinbase user myself, I'll vouch that one of the cool things about their platform is that they often do giveaways of free tokens when they add a new listing. They currently have such a giveaway going on for the recently listed <strong>Stellar Lumen</strong> token. Watching a couple of investor education videos about the Lumen will earn you $10 in free tokens, with rewards up to an additional $40 possible if you invite friends who complete the course. If you've set up your Coinbase account, you can get started earning free Lumens <a href="https://coinbase.com/earn/xlm/invite/g1xy28hs">here</a>.</li>
        <li>The old business reporter in me says now is also a good time to disclose to the reader that my Coinbase account is currently long Basic Attention Token, Bitcoin, Stellar Lumen, and Ripple, each in very small amounts. No <a href="https://crypto-to-lambo.com/">"Lambo money"</a> for me yet... At any rate, I mention this just to contextualize my other content and let you be the judge of any conflicts of interest. I'm also <em>not</em> trying to give anyone personal investment advice. You should do your own homework -- and probably consult a financial adviser -- before putting any serious money into this stuff.</li>
        <li>Finally, a shout-out to newsletter subscriber <strong>Ali Jackson</strong>, who's been picking my brain offline about blockchain lately. Without spilling too many beans, I'll just say the ostensible point is that I'm supposed to be helping Ali out. But the deeper truth is that he helps <em>me</em> out a lot by keeping me focused on real-world applications for blockchain and the needs of the 90-plus percent of folks who have yet to get involved in the space... By the way, Ali is a professional musician, the longtime drummer for the <a href="http://jalc.org/">Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra</a> led by <strong>Wynton Marsalis</strong>. Best way to buy his music is via his personal website <a href="http://alidrums.com/store/">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr today, and for your interest in Web 3.0!</p>
