  <h3>Week in Review: Nov. 24-30, 2019</h3>

  <p>The latest Web 3.0 news from around the internet:</p>

 <ul>
 
  <li>In a <strong>New York Times</strong> op-ed, <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/opinion/world-wide-web.html">proposed</a> a new Contract for the Web to help fix his greatest creation. He describes the contract as "a global plan of action created over the past year by activists, academics, companies, governments and citizens from across the world to make sure our online world is safe, empowering and genuinely for everyone." The contract also now has <a href="https://contractfortheweb.org/?utm_source=https://indizr.com">its own website</a>, where you can personally endorse it if you like, or download the contract as a PDF.</li>
  
  <li>Fascinating interview of <strong>CoinMarketCap</strong>'s chief strategist <strong>Carylyne Chan</strong> and head of research <strong>Gerald Chee</strong> on <strong>Laura Shin</strong>'s Unchained podcast. I'd say this one is really <a href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/why-coinmarketcap-launched-its-liquidity-metric/">a must-listen</a> for anyone interested in the crypto markets, considering what a crucial data source CoinMarketCap is for anyone who trades. As ever, Shin gets straight to the point with her guests, covering a lot of background about how CoinMarketCap has evolved so far and hints about what's to come.</li>
  
  <li>Another podcast highlight: <strong>Foundr</strong> checked in with <strong>Gabriel Weinberg</strong>, founder and CEO of <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong>, the privacy-oriented web browser <a href="https://foundr.com/gabriel-weinberg-duckduckgo">taking on Google</a>.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Zebras Unite</strong> founder <strong>Astrid Scholz</strong> did <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/news/123732/why-silicon-valley-needs-to-dump-unicorns-for-zebras">a Q&A with PC Magazine's S.C. Stuart</a> about her vision to re-make startup funding. As an alternative to Silicon Valley venture capital's perpetual pursuit of "unicorn" startups, Scholz's org advocates a "zebra" approach in which companies grow organically through -- gasp! -- actual revenue.</li>

  <li><strong>MakerDAO</strong>'s recent move to <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/making-maker-november-2019/">multi-collateral financing</a> of its DAI stablecoin spawned the new abbreviation MCD, which in turn has now spawned the social hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuchCoolerDai">#MuchCoolerDAI</a>. Because of course.</li>

  <li><strong>Bloomberg's Ben Brody</strong> reports that federal authorities investigating <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Google</strong> for possible antitrust violations increasingly see privacy as part of their case. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/privacy-lapses-could-be-part-of-google-facebook-antitrust-cases">emerging theory</a> is that tech giants' privacy practices could be used as legal evidence of abusive treatment of consumers -- a common trait of monopolistic companies of earlier eras.</li>

  <li><strong>Google</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-25/google-fires-four-employees-citing-data-security-violations">fired four employees</a> for alleged violations of the company's internal data-privacy rules. But supporters of the workers <strong>say the move was really retaliation</strong> for their in-house opposition to Google's military contracts, development of a censored search engine to appease the Chinese Communist Party, and other sensitive projects.</li>
 
 
  <li><strong>Apple</strong> is also getting its share of antitrust scrutiny these days. In new written testimony to the a U.S. House committee, <strong>Kyle Andeer</strong>, Apple’s vice president of corporate law, answered questions about whether the phone maker's repair policies are unduly restrictive for the sake of creating user lock-in. Andeer repeatedly denied the accusations, but <strong>Motherboard</strong> tech reporter <strong>Matthew Gault</strong> is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjw3w4/apple-tells-congress-youll-hurt-yourself-if-you-try-to-fix-your-iphone">skeptical</a>, to say the least.</li>

 
  <li><strong>ICYMI:</strong> Just in time for the holidays, some insane person on Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/ant_muulah/status/1198042936170237953">claiming</a> that <strong>King's Hawaiian sweet rolls</strong> "have" to be baked in an oven before they're served. Pure madness!</li>


</ul>
