# Why is Big Tech so frosty on blockchain?

**Imagine a new technology** growing to trillions of dollars in market value in less than 20 years, largely without involvement by U.S.-based Big Tech. In fact, more than 70% of its valuation comes from software that's fully open source, including even the systems' algorithms.

To me, that sounds like a massive, historic success story. It is of course also the story of blockchain tech, [dominated](https://btctools.io/stats/dominance) (so far) by the open Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

But the story often isn't told in quite those terms, is it?

At the very least, I believe the mainstream tech press is missing a huge story hiding in plain sight by not juxtaposing the rise of blockchain versus Big Tech's relative reticence toward it. Something doesn't add up there.

To be sure, Silicon Valley's venture capital firms *are* heavily invested in blockchain. But it's a markedly different story among the publicly traded, household-name tech brands that dominate users' everyday experience of the internet.

There are a few notable exceptions in that cohort, like Meta's stablecoin project that was [eventually killed](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/metas-crypto-project-diem-to-shut-down-after-pushback-from-regulators/). But these outliers ultimately just underscore the general pattern of Silicon Valley's heavyweight public companies staying away crypto.

According to CoinMarketCap, the global token market is currently worth $1.8 *trillion,* by the way. With a "t." When else have we ever known Big Tech to effectively skip a pot of money that big?

Offhand, I see two possible explanations:

The first is that Big Tech's approach should invalidate open, decentralized tools like Bitcoin and Ethereum as consequential innovations that the rest of us should take seriously. After all, the likes of Google, Apple, and Amazon are the smartest guys in the room technically, so we should respect their judgment. Right?

The second possible explanation is rooted more in Big Tech's profit incentives than their technical prowess: Perhaps their neglect of public blockchains tacitly *confirms that such things are their kryptonite.* Not being stupid, Big Tech readily perceives that public chains' core principle of decentralization is ultimately incompatible with their proprietary business models around hoarding user data and purposefully breaking compatibility with competitors' products.  

Thus they stay away. But if this reading of the situation is right, it's exactly why the rest of us *should* probably give public blockchains a chance.

# Week in Review

- **Bitcoin leapt 11% for the week** and [touched a two-year high](https://www.investors.com/news/bitcoin-price-above-47000-bitcoin-etf-launch-crypto-prices-rally/) above $48,000 thanks to [strong inflows](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-tastes-48-000-as-ethereum-and-avalanche-follow-led-by-record-etf-asset-inflows-the-week-in-retrospect/ar-BB1i4Wu1) of new investment into exchange-traded funds tracking the token. Meanwhile, miners are [jockeying for position](https://decrypt.co/216101/bitcoin-halving-nears-and-btc-miner-cleanspark-is-preparing-for-lower-fees) in the upcoming halving, a periodic event in which rewards for minting new tokens are reduced for the sake of limiting supply and controlling inflation.

- **Consensys announced** that its popular MetaMask wallet will [integrate with Robinhood's platform](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/metamask-robinhood-connect-integrate-easier-150000873.html) to enable easier crypto trading for users.

- **Solana Labs** said that a five-hour network outage on Tuesday was caused by a bug developers spotted a week earlier on their testnet. ([CryptoSlate](https://cryptoslate.com/solana-outage-was-caused-by-infinite-loop-bug-previously-seen-on-devnet/))

- **Binance said** it will delist four tokens on Feb. 20, [including Monero](https://decrypt.co/215981/monero-binance-delists-xmr).

- **New York state's attorney general** expanded a previously filed lawsuit against Digital Currency Group, its Genesis Global Capital unit, and Gemini Trust, alleging they engaged in a $3 billion fraud. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/09/new-york-attorney-general-crypto-fraud-lawsuit-winklevoss-twins-letitia-james))

- **South Korean police arrested** three executives at Haru Invest, a crypto yield platform, for allegedly stealing $828 million in customer funds. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/02/06/haru-invest-execs-arrested-in-south-korea-for-allegedly-stealing-828m-worth-of-crypto-report/))

- **For a second straight year, crypto companies won't be advertising at the Super Bowl.** Market conditions are greatly improved from a year ago, but companies remain chastened compared to 2022's "Crypto Bowl." Many are instead spending on lobbying Congress or marketing to the masses outside the U.S. ([Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/crypto-absent-again-super-bowl-ads))

- **Netflix's dystopian tech series Black Mirror** has a new promotional tie-in [built on web3](https://decrypt.co/215410/black-mirror-goes-web3-with-pixelynx-smile-to-earn-experience). (To be specific, it uses Coinbase's layer-2 platform Base.) Called the ["Smile Club"](https://www.blackmirrorexperience.com/register), the new "digital experience" is based on Black Mirror's recent episode titled "Nosedive" in which a social credit scoring system effectively wrecks the characters' lives.

# Odds & Ends

- **AI updates:** A California state senator is [proposing new regulations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/08/california-legislation-artificial-intelligence-regulation/) that would require artificial-intelligence companies to test their software for "unsafe" behaviors. In Italy, archaelogistss are using AI to translate delicate, previously unreadable papyrus scrolls salvaged from an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius [2,000 years ago](https://decrypt.co/215975/archaeologists-ai-ancient-scrolls-mount-vesuvius).

- **Save the sardines!** Writing for Slate, environmental educator Russell Jacobs says we're not paying enough attention to fostering [populations of small sea creatures](https://slate.com/technology/2024/02/ocean-conservation-menhaden-fisheries-fish-oil.html) as a way to improve the oceans' ecology.
