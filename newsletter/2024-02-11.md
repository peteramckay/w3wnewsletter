**Imagine a new technology** growing to trillions of dollars in market value in less than 20 years, largely without involvement by U.S.-based Big Tech. In fact, more than 70% of its valuation comes from software that's fully open source, *including even the systems' algorithms*.

To me, that sounds like a raging success story. It is of course also the story of blockchain technology, dominated (so far) by the open Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

But the story often isn't told in quite those terms, is it?

- What do you think a counterweight to big tech looks like?

But the story often isn't told in terms like the ones I used just now, is it?

News flash: Anything that involves human beings and money is subject to scams. Yes, crypto has them. But so does the stock market. So does real estate. So do umpteen other markets. Do you just dismiss all of them out of hand?

Yes, there are scammers, and there are honest people trying to build things of actual value. Both parts are true at once.



Jack Grubman. Did that mean that Amazon was always a scam? No, Jack Grubman's research about Amazon's stock was a scam. But Amazon had real long-term value.

- Confusing tech with tech companies.

- Creating false dichotomies.

If I were a company on the short end of Big Tech's increasingly anticompetitive practices -- which describes pretty much every company in the world -- I would wonder if this amazing software might be useful to me. At the very least, I'd study how it succeeded very closely, for  

It's of course also the story of blockchain's rise, dominated by just two open-source projects, Bitcoin and Ethereum.


What do you think that looks like in the real world? And if this isn't it, what would be?

In the abstract, I think that sounds like a raging success story to most people.

Specifically, it describes blockchain to a tee.

They frame the story in terms of Big Tech. Bluntly, they suck at covering open standards in general.

Lead item. ~450 words. Riff on absence of Big Tech in crypto and why it matters.

- Big Tech's absence is an unsung killer feature of web3

- Big Tech's absence is mostly a blessing in crypto, but also has some downsides. There is less attention paid.

- It's an underrated achievement of crypto that it's grown into a multitrillion-dollar industry in less than 20 years with minimal involvement by Big Tech.

# Odds & Ends

- **For a second straight year, crypto companies won't be advertising at the Super Bowl.** Market conditions are greatly improved from a year ago, but companies remain chastened compared to 2022's "Crypto Bowl." Many are instead spending on lobbying Congress or marketing to the masses outside the U.S. ([Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/crypto-absent-again-super-bowl-ads))

- **Netflix's dystopian tech series Black Mirror** has a new promotional tie-in [built on web3](https://decrypt.co/215410/black-mirror-goes-web3-with-pixelynx-smile-to-earn-experience). (To be specific, it uses Coinbase's layer-2 platform Base.) Called the ["Smile Club"](https://www.blackmirrorexperience.com/register), the new "digital experience" is based on Black Mirror's recent episode titled "Nosedive" in which a social credit scoring system effectively wrecks the characters' lives.
