<!--

Lead item. ~450 words. Riff on absence of Big Tech in crypto and why it matters.

- Big Tech's absence is an unsung killer feature of web3

- Big Tech's absence is mostly a blessing in crypto, but also has some downsides. There is less attention paid.

- Crypto offers better investment returns than Big Tech, but less of a cultural footprint among users.

- It's an underrated achievement of crypto that it's grown into a multitrillion-dollar industry with minimal involvement by Big Tech.
