**The token market** racked up a second straight week of big gains, raising traders' confidence that [crypto winter](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-winter-203319408.html) is [definitively over](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/10/24/a-wall-street-giant-has-declared-crypto-winter-over-as-bitcoin-smashes-30000-and-the-price-of-ethereum-and-xrp-suddenly-soar/).

A few key numbers that illustrate the rally's winners and losers so far:

- **$220 billion:** The two-week increase in the global token market's valuation. In percentage terms, valuation has risen 21% to $1.27 trillion total. However, the market is still 58% off its all-time high set in November 2021, according to CoinMarketCap data.

- **53%**: Bitcoin's current share of the global market. That so-called "bitcoin dominance" is now at a [30-month high](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/25/bitcoin-dominance-hits-fresh-30-month-high-as-ether-altcoins-lag-in-rally/), as the token has benefited from heavy speculation that U.S. approval of an exchange-traded bitcoin fund is imminent. There's also one less-pleasant factor at work that I think we should discuss...

- **3,445:** Number of tokens that have either been de-listed by exchanges this year or appear imminently at risk for such. That's a new record going back to 2016, according to [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/cryptocurrency-delistings-from-exchanges-are-running-at-a-record-pace-this-year). Many of the de-listed coins were no doubt subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission's ongoing crackdown on the industry this year. It's also possible exchanges preemptively removed a few to avoid potential problems down the line. The net effect is that the market's [long tail](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-tail.asp) of smaller token projects is thinning out. Effectively, that also helps to boost the market share of bitcoin, ether, and other mega-caps.

- **6%:** Two-week decline in the Nasdaq Composite Index, which tracks many U.S.-listed tech stocks. In other words, crypto and mainstream tech investing have [diverged sharply](https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/dwayne-johnson-explains-how-exactly-black-adam-will-change-the-dceus-hierarchy-of-power/) the last two weeks, which is unusual. If tech stocks stay in the doldrums awhile longer, and if a U.S. bitcoin ETF is approved as expected, we could be looking at a permanent change in tech's "hierarchy of power," to borrow a phrase from noted market theorist Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

- **$280 billion:** Market value shed last week by Big Tech's "Magnificent Seven" companies (Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Tesla, Netflix, Microsoft, and Nvidia) following a round of mostly disappointing earnings reports.  

- **7%:** Quarterly decline in market valuation of tokens that [use a proof-of-stake algorithm](https://www.theblock.co/post/259632/proof-of-stake-asset-market-capitalization-drops-7-to-254-billion) to verify on-chain transactions. That's bad news for anyone concerned about crypto's power usage as PoW requires a fraction of the energy consumption of proof-of-stake networks like Bitcoin.

- **#93:** Current ranking of Luna Terra Classic ([LUNC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/)) in CoinMarketCap's listing of tokens by global valuation. LUNC recently completed a surprising return to the top 100 after falling almost to zero in May 2022 when its sister token, the UST stablecoin, lost its peg to the U.S. Dollar. The debacle wiped out $45 billion in market value and led to fraud charges against Terraform Labs CEO [Do Kwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Kwon). However, an open source community has since been maintaining the LUNC token, implementing tighter controls on supply of the token, and making other changes that have quietly helped it stage a comeback, according to [The Merkle](https://themerkle.com/lunc-to-re-enter-top-100-crypto-rankings-while-the-bitcoin-spark-ico-is-trending/).

### Week in Review

For all the focus on token prices lately, there have been important headlines elsewhere in the industry as well. Let's get to some of them:

- **FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried testified** in his own defense against federal fraud charges. The former CEO said he never intended to defraud customers and was unaware of key decisions made by his lieutenants. Prosecutors will cross examine him Monday in New York. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/27/sbf-ftx-trial-testifies-fraud-crypto))

- **Bloomberg News released** a new [long-form documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QpdU9LS540) about the fall of FTX and how it happened. I highly recommend watching this one, as it manages to be both comprehensive and layman-friendly.

- **BlockFi has emerged from bankruptcy.** The lender will begin winding down operations, continue to pursue payments from distressed counterparties, and return money to investors. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-lender-blockfi-emerges-bankruptcy-2023-10-24/))

- **Fortress CEO Scott Purcell stepped down** down after a proposed sale of the crypto custodian to Ripple fell through. Rich Hauschild, former COO of iTrustCapital, will take over the top job. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/10/24/fortress-ceo-scott-purcell-steps-down-layoffs-ripple-acquisition/))

- **MasterCard and MoonPay** announced a [new partnership](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/25/mastercard-teams-up-with-moonpay-for-web3-push/) to improve customer loyalty and availability of web3 payments.

- **Artificial intelligence data centers** are on track to consume 4.3 gigawatts of power globally in 2023, according to a [new white paper](https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SPD_WP110_EN&p_enDocType=White+Paper&p_File_Name=WP110_V1.1_EN.pdf) from the French energy-management company Schneider Electric. TechRadar notes that usage is already [equivalent to some countries' annual power demand](https://www.techradar.com/pro/ai-usage-power-consumption-is-now-similar-to-many-small-countries) and could quintuple by 2028.

### Odds & Ends

- **Huh?** Fantom co-founder Andre Cronje says blockchain tech is "stuck in the eighties." ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/203217/blockchain-tech-is-stuck-eighties-says-fantoms-andre-cronje))

- **Sometimes the headline really does say it all.** A doozie that just ran in the MIT Technology Review: ["Death to captchas"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/24/1081139/captchas-ai-websites-computing/)

- **Move over, AI.** Biologist Jonathan Losos says housecats could eventually evolve to rule the world. ([Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/house-cats-evolution-anthropocene-extinction.html))
