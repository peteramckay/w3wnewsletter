A few datapoints and observations about the latest crypto rally:

- Bitcoin dominance is at a 30-month high. Gains driven not just by bitcoin's impressive price gains. token de-listings: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/cryptocurrency-delistings-from-exchanges-are-running-at-a-record-pace-this-year | https://www.coindesk.com/video/more-tokens-are-being-delisted-from-crypto-exchanges-this-year-kaiko/

- **Bitcoin's market share is also getting a boost from an unlikely, quite unwitting ally.**


- PoS market cap is down 7%. https://bitcoinist.com/proof-of-stake-market-cap-takes-a-7-hit/

- Ethereum's market share has barely budged. Frankly, I don't think we should be calling it an "altcoin" anymore, as it inceasingly looks like a permanent feature of the landscape.

- Solana

- BUSD winding down: https://www.theblock.co/post/259380/busd-down-fdusd-binance
