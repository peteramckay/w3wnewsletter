# Post-FTX, many users still turn to crypto exchanges

**Exchanges are still a crucial cog** in the crypto market, even after the meltdown of FTX late last year.

Consider: Coinbase reported [solid quarterly earnings](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-earnings-revenue-losses-beat-expectations-as-volumes-plunge-to-cap-2022-215528339.html) report on Tuesday. It's also in talks [with the New York Stock Exchange's parent company](https://bitcoinist.com/iex-coinbase-federally-approved-crypto-exchange/) to create a new fully reuglated crypto marketplace. Meanwhile, cometitor Binance is looking to gobble up $1 billion in assets from of bankrupt lender Voyager.

Regulators are [objecting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sec-opposes-binanceus-1-bln-voyager-deal-coindesk-2023-02-23/) to that bid. But you get the point: These platforms are looking to expand right now, not fading into the background due to any seismic post-FTX shift in customer behavior.

Blockchain purists see FTX's meltdown as a cautionary tale to avoid the worst sins of traditional finance. They argue that that the whole point of tokenization is for users to have increased control over their assets, without interference by middlemen.

In this view, letting *any* exchange maintain custody of your crypto wallet, including possession of the encryption keys, just defeats the whole purpose.

However, many non-technical users clearly have a different perspective. For them, exchanges offer user-friendly interfaces and less hassle than [cold storage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cold-storage.asp) of their tokens. Thus the exchanges remain an attractive option for these users, in a trade-off of convenience for more high-minded values that's common elsewhere in tech.

For instance, you can point out until you're blue in the face that iPhones and laptops are made under [brutal working conditions](https://apnews.com/article/technology-health-social-media-covid-apple-inc-de96ca707008f1ae48820ed573c56865) in China. But how many users will actually ditch their devices or shift their purchasing decisions because of it? Vanishingly few.
