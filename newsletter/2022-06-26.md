# Privacy issues abound post-Roe  
## #Web3 Weekly: June 19-25, 2022

**The U.S. Supreme Court's** historic [undoing of abortion rights](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/24/supreme-court-ruling-abortion-dobbs/?itid=ap_robertbarnes&itid=lk_inline_manual_6) last week carries serious privacy implications, many touching upon handling of digital data.

For all the media punditry about America "returning" to the status quo of 1973, when [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) was originally decided by the court, this is one area that will decidedly *not* be the same in 2022 and beyond. Technology has changed a ton since Roe, so now there will be altogether new risks.

Ahead of the court's latest decision, Wired magazine documented how data from mobile health apps [might soon be weaponized](https://www.wired.com/story/fertility-data-weaponized/) against women seeking illegal abortions. In particular, information from apps that track fertility or users' menstrual cycles might now be sold by data brokers or subpoenaed by law enforcement to prosecute abortion patients or even medical professionals who treat them.

In a followup, Wired decried an emerging "post-Roe privacy nightmare" and [provided further tips](https://www.wired.com/story/post-roe-privacy-russia-ukraine-hacks/) for users to protect their information. Frankly, many are standard infosec hygiene: Use encrypted messaging apps, switch to DuckDuckGo instead of Google search, disable web trackers in your browser, and so on. But it certainly never hurts to remind people of such precautions, I guess.

Several news outlets also highlighted a disturbing detail of the conservative Supreme Court majority's [opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf) overturning Roe: It rests on a very [narrow reading of the Constitution's 14th Amendment](https://www.yahoo.com/news/14th-amendment-does-roe-v-001141838.html), which was ratified after the Civil War to establish full citizenship rights for freed slaves.

The amendment's language has since been interpreted broadly to grant all citizens an array of "unenumerated rights" that aren't explicitly mantioned in the Constitution, including the only real federal protections of personal privacy. Now, under the same reasoning that struck down Roe, some of those other rights may be in jeopardy a well.

In a [news analysis](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/25/us/supreme-court-abortion-contraception-same-sex-marriage.html) published Friday, the New York Times' Charlie Savage explained:

> In addition to declaring a right to abortion, the court struck down involuntary sterilization and laws interfering with who people could choose to live with or marry, along with decriminalizing contraception and same-sex intercourse.
>
> The heart of Justice Alito’s majority opinion is that the 14th Amendment protects only unwritten rights that were already understood to exist in 1868, when it was adopted. Many states then banned abortion, so it was wrong for the Supreme Court, in 1973’s Roe v. Wade, to interpret the 14th Amendment as encompassing a right to abortion, he reasoned.

So there you go. If you follow the line of reasoning the Supreme Court majority offered last week to its conclusion, American society could be headed back not to 1973 but to 1868 in terms of many rights.

There's a lot that could be said about that situation. But for our purposes here, let it suffice that it's a great reason to do a checkup of which digital services and devices you're using, how they're handling your data, and whether some might have to go or have their settings modified.
