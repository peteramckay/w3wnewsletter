**The $100 bill** is now America's most popular cash denomination, with more of them in circulation than even the venerable $1 note bearing George Washington's likeness.

So says the Wall Street Journal's Oyin Adedoyin in a [recent story](https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/american-dollar-currency-100-bill-c6a47c79?st=02dgeljm8vby6zg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about the [c-note](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-note.asp)'s meteoric rise. Adedoyin reports that more than half the supply of $100 bills is held abroad, and there are enough $100 bills circulating in the U.S. for every living citizen to have 55 of them.

Leftover copy that needs a re-write...

Let it also suffice that all these bills aren't being spent to treat someone's local Little League team at McDonald's.

I want to applify this story here because it seems useful context to the perpetual hand-wringing over cryptocurrencies' role in illicit activity.

That is a real problem, no question. I'm not here for a full-blown round of [whataboutism](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=whataboutism) by any mens.

But I do think it's worth keeping in perspective that there's a much bigger illegal trade going on the old-fashioned way, via cash. If we really want to put a dent in problems like drug trafficking

Sure, let's eliminate the portion that's conducted in crypto. But if you really want to combat harms like drug trafficking and teorrorism by cutting off funding, the core of the issue is still cash-based, all the way.

# Week in Review

- **The rally in token prices accelerated,** pushing major market indicators within reach of all-time records set in November 2021. Bitcoin led the way, jumping 22% for the week to top $60,000 per token. It was helped by growing anticipation of a [network "halving" next month](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-bitcoins-upcoming-halving-differs-from-the-cryptos-previous-cycles-6813e4a4), which would [tighten bitcoin supply](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/02/22/crypto-for-advisors-bitcoins-4th-halving-is-approaching/). The token's price is now within 11% of its all-time high. The broader crypto market's valuation, which now stands at $2.4 trillion, is 27% from its record.

- **Ethereum developers wrap up their annual Denver conference today.** Many of the gathering's major panels and keynote speeches are viewable on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ETHDenver). Full schedule and other conference details are available on ETH Denver's official site [here](https://www.ethdenver.com/).

- **Ten Wall Street firms,** including BlackRock and Fidelity, have [submitted proposals](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/bitcoin-etfs-ether-investing-cryptocurrency-8d2f4d55) to U.S. regulators to offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding ether. Such listings would be similar financially to the bitcoin ETFs approved and launched in January. But from a governance standpoint, S&P Global analysts [warned](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/240220-u-s-ether-etfs-could-exacerbate-concentration-risk-13009237) that ether ETFs could throw a wrench in the Ethereum network's staking mechanism by concentrating too much power with the fund issuers on Wall Street.

- **Reddit's IPO filing** revealed that the social platform holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, and Polygon's MATIC tokens as part of its corporate treasury and to make payments. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/02/23/what-reddits-ipo-filing-says-about-crypto-regulation/))

- **Lens Protocol,** a platform for putting social data on-chain, has gone permissionless. Users can now participate in the network by creating a non-fungible token for their profile. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/279335/blockchain-based-social-graph-lens-enters-permissionless-phase))

- **Venture funding of U.S. startups with Black founders** fell 71% in 2023, greatly outpacing the industrywide 37% decline in startup funding. Investment in Black founders totaled just $705 million, the lowest figure since 2016, according to a 2-part series by Crunchbase News. The first installment is [here](https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/venture-funding-black-founded-startups-2023-data/), and the second is [here](https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/black-founder-startup-investment-bay-area-atlanta-boston-data/).

- **Apple canceled** its development of an electric car and will shift many of the engineers to AI projects instead. ([Engadget](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/the-apple-car-project-is-reportedly-dead/ar-BB1iZNdP))

- **Chipmaker Nvidia's valuation** has soared over $2 trillion thanks to the recent AI boom, raising the personal profile of founder and CEO Jensen Huang as well. But rivals and even customers are increasingly looking for alternatives to Nvidia's chips in order to keep the company's influence in check. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-vision-company-f05db212?st=uydjpbt6y2q0hqw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

# Odds & Ends

- **The Center for Climate Integrity** says in a [new report](https://climateintegrity.org/plastics-fraud) that plastic recycling is "a public fraud" that "is not technically or economically viable at scale."

- **Does coffee have so many health benefits** that it qualifies as a "liquid vegetable?" The Washington Post [investigates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/27/coffee-diabetes-health-benefits/).
