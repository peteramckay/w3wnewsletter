**The $100 bill** is now America's most popular cash denomination, with more of them in circulation than even the venerable $1 note bearing George Washington's likeness.

So says the Wall Street Journal's Oyin Adedoyin in a [recent story](https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/american-dollar-currency-100-bill-c6a47c79?st=02dgeljm8vby6zg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about the [c-note](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-note.asp)'s meteoric rise. Adedoyin reports that more than half the supply of $100 bills is held abroad, and there are enough $100 bills circulating in the U.S. for every living citizen to have 55 of them.

Leftover copy that needs a re-write...

Let it also suffice that all these bills aren't being spent to treat someone's local Little League team at McDonald's.

I want to applify this story here because it seems useful context to the perpetual hand-wringing over cryptocurrencies' role in illicit activity.

That is a real problem, no question. I'm not here for a full-blown round of [whataboutism](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=whataboutism) by any mens.

But I do think it's worth keeping in perspective that there's a much bigger illegal trade going on the old-fashioned way, via cash. If we really want to put a dent in problems like drug trafficking

Sure, let's eliminate the portion that's conducted in crypto. But if you really want to combat harms like drug trafficking and teorrorism by cutting off funding, the core of the issue is still cash-based, all the way.

- 2023 saw a significant drop in venture funding to Black-founded startups in the US, with a 71% decrease in funding compared to the previous year. This decline is much steeper than the overall market decline of 37%. The total investment in Black-founded startups last year was only $705 million, the lowest amount since 2016. This represents less than 0.5% of the total venture funding received by all US-based startups. The Open Opportunity Fund's Paul Judge calls this a $17 billion problem and suggests showing investors the return potential of startups with diverse leadership to find a solution. https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/venture-funding-black-founded-startups-2023-data/

- Bitcoin surged above $57,000, marking its highest level since November 2021. The surge occurred during early Tuesday morning Asia hours, with the price pulling back slightly to $56,500 at the time of writing. The rally began on Monday, with bitcoin taking out several round number milestones. The move higher in bitcoin also spurred sizable activity in U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs, with the group posting a record-high $2.4 billion in trading volume on Monday. CoinDesk's managing editor for Markets, Stephen Alpher, who holds BTC above CoinDeskâ€™s disclosure threshold of $1,000, contributed to this report. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/27/bitcoin-tops-57k-as-rally-picks-up-steam/

- Nvidia, led by CEO Jensen Huang, has seen a remarkable rise in the AI-driven business boom, making it essential for tech companies like Microsoft and Tesla. However, this success has also made Nvidia a target for competitors and even some customers looking to minimize its dominance. Intel, AMD, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are developing their own AI chip offerings, while Nvidia focuses on expanding its use in other industries and securing its future. Nvidia, with a 61-year-old Taiwanese-born CEO, remains the AI race's frontrunner, with a 3.5x revenue increase in the latest quarter and a 9x profit rise, despite competitors' and customers' attempts to diminish its dominance. https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-vision-company-f05db212

- Wall Street firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have applied to launch Ether ETFs, following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs a few weeks ago. These ETFs would give everyday investors the opportunity to invest in Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency. However, critics warn that approval of these ETFs could expose investors to more risks than they might realize, as Ether is known for its volatility and potential for price manipulation. The SEC has until May to approve or reject the first application for a spot Ether ETF and is expected to make a decision for all applications simultaneously. https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/bitcoin-etfs-ether-investing-cryptocurrency-8d2f4d55

- The price of Worldcoin, an AI-related token co-created by OpenAI's founder, Sam Altman, reached a record high of $8.85 on Thursday. This increase is part of a broader rally in AI-related tokens, sparked by Nvidia's strong earnings report and sales forecast. Other AI-themed cryptocurrencies, such as SingularityNET, FetchAI, The Graph, and Render, also experienced significant gains. This surge might be due to increased optimism around AI, as well as potential demand from investors unable to access U.S. equities. However, the connection between these tokens and the actual adoption of AI technology remains unclear, as their use in AI applications is still experimental. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/22/worldcoin-gains-40-hits-record-high-as-ai-tokens-surge-on-nvidia/


- Reddit, a major social media platform, has revealed it holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon's MATIC in its treasury and as a means of payment. This move is significant as Reddit has been at the forefront of experimenting with crypto tokens, NFTs, and blockchain tools. The company's SEC filing also highlights its view on crypto regulation, stating that Ethereum's native token is not likely to be considered a security. However, Reddit also acknowledges the risks associated with holding crypto, including the potential loss of private keys and regulatory restrictions. The company is subject to rules such as SAB 121, which requires tracking of crypto holdings and maintaining reserves, and GAAP, which impacts how crypto is recognized on the balance sheet. Overall, Reddit's move into crypto demonstrates the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/02/23/what-reddits-ipo-filing-says-about-crypto-regulation/

# Odds & Ends

- A cybersecurity firm's leaked documents reveal China's focus on tracking ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs. The documents suggest a Chinese company, I-Soon, was involved in hacking and surveillance efforts targeting these minorities, both within and outside China's borders. I-Soon's capabilities included accessing email accounts, GPS location data, and activating device microphones. This news highlights the challenges in preserving free speech and privacy within China's current political climate. https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-hacking-documents-target-ethnic-minorities-1c582813
