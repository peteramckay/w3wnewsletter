**I'm breaking in two new members** of the newsletter team this week -- an editorial assistant and an illustrator.

They're both artificially intelligent bots.

To be more specific, they are early-stage products from the startup
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The company recently did initial public releases of an image generator, cheekily dubbed [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), and a bot called [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) that gives text-based responses to user queries.  

I've been hearing a lot about these AIs lately, especially ChatGPT, so I decided to sign up and try integrating them into my workflow for the newsletter this week.

To summarize, I would say my results were mixed. ChatGPT and DALL-E both clearly have limitations right now, but also a lot of promise as they inevitably evolve. The nightmare scenario that Harvard prof Heidi Legg tktktk fretted about TKTKTKTK on Twitter

To put it in familiar sci-fi terms, these products right now are nowhere close to being terminators (which we of course wouldn't want anyway) or even Data from Star Trek, friendly and fully autonomous. They're more like R2-D2, handy assistants who can do some specific tasks pretty well if you direct them properly.

The latest headlines:

- Sam Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that he cheated investors in his now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange and caused billions of dollars in losses. Bankman-Fried faces eight criminal counts, including wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. He could face up to 115 years in prison if convicted. The trial is set for October 2. (https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-set-enter-not-guilty-plea-ftx-fraud-case-2023-01-03/)

- **FTX updates:**  FTX announced a [new agreement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-and-ftx-dm-bahamas-announce-cooperation-agreement-301715690.html) between its corporate entities in the U.S. and Bahamas to cooperate in resolving civil bankruptcy proceedings in both jurisdictions. Meanwhile, exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried is fighting to retain personal control of [$450 million in Robinhood shares](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/06/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-keep-grasp-on-450m-in-robinhood-shares/), arguing they were bought using money borrowed from FTX's trading arm, Alameda Research. Separately, Alameda joined state and federal regulators in [objecting](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/05/bankman-frieds-alameda-joins-chorus-objecting-to-binance-voyager-buy/) to Binance.US's proposed purchase of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital for $1 billion.

- **U.S. prosecutors** have posted a [webpage](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/united-states-v-samuel-bankman-fried-aka-sbf-22-cr-673-lak) asking FTX customers or other creditors to contact them if you believe you were defrauded by founder Sam Bankman-Fried. They're looking for witnesses to build their case against Bankman-Fried.

- **Decrypt published** a handy [explainer](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-proof-reserves-why-do-they-matter) about proof of reserves on crypto exchanges and why they matter.  

- Celsius Network has won ownership of over $4.2bn worth of customer funds after a prolonged legal battle. A US judge ruled that the funds, deposited into Celsius' interest-bearing accounts, are the property of the firm and can be used as it sees fit. The ruling comes after Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July and has been involved in various legal battles to secure its assets. The firm announced in December that it would sell $18m worth of stablecoins to fund its restructuring plan. (https://247wallst.com/investing/2023/01/05/celsius-wins-ownership-of-4-2b-worth-of-customers-funds/)

- New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Alex Mashinsky, a former CEO of cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network and its related entities, alleging that he defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. The lawsuit seeks to ban Mashinsky from doing business in New York, require him to pay damages, restitution and disgorgement, and bar him from serving as a director or officer of any company doing business in New York. Mashinsky repeatedly made false and misleading statements about Celsius's safety to encourage investors to deposit billions of dollars in digital assets onto the platform, according to the lawsuit.

- **The Block reports** that bitcoin futures trading activity ["fell off cliff"](https://www.theblock.co/post/199817/bitcoin-futures-activity-fell-off-cliff-in-december) in December. Monthly volume fell 36% to its lowest level since October 2020 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

- **SuperRare,** a trading platform for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), announced it will [cut staff by 30%](https://decrypt.co/118615/nft-marketplace-superrare-cuts-30-of-staff-we-over-hired). CEO John Crain said the company had been overly aggressive in its previous hiring and that he takes "full ownership of this mistake."

- **No one is going to steal your startup idea.** Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbrandolph/status/1606168786918289408) to dispel this common -- and highly overblown -- fear among founders. The much bigger pitfall is not getting started at all, he says.
