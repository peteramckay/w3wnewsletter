**With 2023's first quarter now behind us,** it's a good time to check the big picture for crypto.

Frankly, the most eye-popping part has to be bitcoin's performance. It rose 10 times faster than the S&P 500 in the first period, up 72%, its [best quarterly gain](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-31/bitcoin-s-btc-surge-mkes-it-the-best-performing-asset-in-q1-2023) in two years. And its dominance of the broader crypto market [jumped](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/04/02/is-bitcoin-a-screaming-buy-right-now-this-metric-s/) as well, nearing the 50% threshold again.

As I've noted [previously](https://medium.com/the-modern-scientist/bitcoin-passes-a-big-test-80223963671f), the recent woes of conventional banks have definitely helped to boost bitcoin. That said, the token's price wasn't quite able to break through the $30,000 milestone last week. So it still faces some uphill battles as well in the marketplace.
