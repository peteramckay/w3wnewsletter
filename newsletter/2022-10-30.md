**Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine** just published a [magnum opus](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#web3) on the crypto industry, a 40,000-word story taking up the *entire issue* of Bloomberg Businessweek's print edition.

This is only the second time in the magazine's 93-year history it has dedicated an entire edition to just one story. So, yeah, the editors clearly thought this topic is a really big deal for their readers.

Even in this "Crypto Winter," Levine says he's convinced blockchain networks and tokens are likely to stick around for the long term, and to play an important role in the world around us. So it's worth taking some time to understand this stuff better.

Working from that premise, Levine proceeds to give a layman-friendly but thorough explanation of blockchain technology, as well as discussion of more recent news in the industry, including the good, the bad, and the inbetween.

The piece is overall a great "guide," as it's billed on the print edition's cover. It's also good to see that Bloomberg, which is normally pretty strict about paywalling content online, has been permissive in making this particular story available. You can [read it for free](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#web3) just by creating an account on Bloomberg's website with your email address.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Crypto jumped, handily outperforming publicly traded tech stocks.** The global token market's valuation climbed back above $1 trillion, helped by a 7% weekly rise in bitcoin. (By comparison, the Nasdaq Composite Index was up just 2%.) [Bitcoin's valuation](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) is now just shy of $400 billion, worth [more than JPMorgan Chase](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPM/key-statistics?p=JPM). The token has been showing improved fundamentals lately, including [a record number of long-term holders](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-record-number-bitcoin-101656223.html) and strong [trading volume versus altcoins](https://blog.kaiko.com/btc-market-share-hits-2-year-high-965238a64e9b).

- **Big Tech's earnings reports contained worrisome signs.** Facebook parent Meta reported a [$3.7 billion quarterly loss](https://decrypt.co/112952/metas-metaverse-division-reports-3-67-billion-quarterly-loss) on Reality Labs, its new metaverse division. Its shares have plunged more than 70% in 2022, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he's [sticking by](https://slate.com/technology/2022/10/facebook-meta-earnings-zuckerberg-metaverse.html) his long-term bet on the metaverse. Elsewhere, Google and Microsoft both reported [disappointing quarterly sales](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63394516). And Amazon shares fell after it forecast a surprisingly [weak holiday shopping season](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/amazons-holiday-shopping-outlook-delivers-more-gloom-than-cheer/) through year-end. But Apple was a [bright spot](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3897488-why-did-apple-shares-rise-nearly-8-on-friday-its-a-rock-of-gibraltar-in-big-tech), up almost 8% Friday after it reported profits ahead of analysts' expectations, driven by strong iPhone sales.

- **Apple updated** its  terms of service for crypto apps. Among [the changes](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/apple-tightens-rules-crypto-nfts-app-store-rcna53905) is a requirement that any sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) be structured as in-app purchases -- thus subject to Apple taking a 30% cut.

Such compliance is controversial among many blockchain purists, including the MEVWatch team, as they consider it government censorship of the Ethereum chain.

Hence his selection as PM is raising fresh hopes among crypto pros for enactment of such policies soon.
