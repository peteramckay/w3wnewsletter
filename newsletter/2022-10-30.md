**Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine** just published a [magnum opus](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#web3) on the crypto industry, a 40,000-word story taking up the *entire issue* of Bloomberg Businessweek's print edition.

This is only the second time in the magazine's 93-year history it has dedicated an entire edition to just one story. So, yeah, the editors clearly thought this topic is a really big deal for their readers.

Even in this "Crypto Winter," Levine says he's convinced blockchain networks and tokens are likely to stick around for the long term, and to play an important role in the world around us. So it's worth taking some time to understand this stuff better.

Working from that premise, Levine proceeds to give a layman-friendly but thorough explanation of blockchain technology, as well as discussion of more recent news in the industry, including the good, the bad, and the inbetween.

The piece is overall a great "guide," as it's billed on the print edition's cover. It's also good to see that Bloomberg, which is normally pretty strict about paywalling content online, has been permissive in making this particular story available. You can [read it for free](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2022-the-crypto-story/?leadSource=uverify%20wall#web3) just by creating an account on Bloomberg's website with your email address.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **A majority of the Ethereum chain is now validated through nodes that comply with U.S. sanctions.** According to data from the mining site [MEVWatch](https://www.mevwatch.info/), 60% of weekly Ethereum transaction blocks through Friday evening were handled through relays that enforce rules set by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control, which enforces sanctions. Such compliance is controversial among many blockchain purists, including the MEVWatch team, as they consider it government censorship of the Ethereum chain.
