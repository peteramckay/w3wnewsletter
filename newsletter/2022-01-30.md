# #Web3Weekly

## Jan. 23-29, 2022

**I'll focus this time on a particularly rich batch** of thoughtful takes about what a more decentralized future should look like. For whatever reason, last week generated a bunch of them.

Yes, tere were also a bunch of notable breaking events, as ever in the decentralization space. But I think this is a good opportunity to focus more on the long-term picture:

- **Web3 isn't necessarily an American phenomenon.** A great [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1486865871129571328) from the Ethereum Foundation's Josh Stark.

- **Facebook isn't ready for this years' elections around the world.** So says Katie Harbath, a former public policy director at Facebook, in a new [guest essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/opinion/facebook-2022-election.html) for The  New York Times. She's urging her former employer to take more agressive steps to combat misinformation and voting manipulation, with elections on tap this year in the U.S., France, Kenya, Australia, Brazil, and the Philippines.

- **"The algorithmic life is not worth living."** The behavior modeling at the heart of the digital economy, embodied by Big Tech's automated parsing of "relevance" for users of its services, is making us all [stupid, boring, and neurotic](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/27/the-algorithmic-life-is-not-worth-living/), says CoinDesk columnist David Z. Morris.

- **Don't let Web3 repeat Web2's mistakes.** A renewal of the internet's founding principle of decentralization should include a strong commitment to [privacy by default](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/26/dont-let-web-3-repeat-web-2s-mistakes/) for users, writes Tor Bair, founder of the Secret Foundation. Speaking of which...

- **How do crypto exchanges use your data?** CoinDesk's Anna Baydakova looked into the practices of [22 major trading platforms](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/privacyweek/2022/01/27/before-you-click-i-agree-how-binance-coinbase-and-22-other-crypto-exchanges-handle-your-data/). She found widespread collection of user information and spotty disclosure of practices concerning its use.

- **The Knight Foundation released a study on free speech attitudes on U.S. campuses.** A joint project with the polling form Ipsos found widespread support among the younger generation for the First Amendment. But on a more worrisome note, [many students are concerned](https://twitter.com/knightfdn/status/1485976815315431431) that their own expression is being adequately protected.


- **America's Southwest ❤️ bitcoin, apparently.** A bill has been introduced in Arizona to [make bitcoin legal tender](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/28/arizona-senator-introduces-bill-to-make-bitcoin-legal-tender/) in the state. In nearby Texas, a candidate for governor is vowing to [do the same thing](https://donhuffines.com/huffines-announces-bitcoin-policy-plans-to-make-texas-the-citadel-for-bitcoin/). Such state-level actions would be largely symbolic without federal legislation, however.
