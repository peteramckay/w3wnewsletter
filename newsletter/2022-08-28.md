**Ethereum's hotly anticipated network upgrade** just got some welcome mainstream attention from the New York Times, which published a handy [explainer](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/technology/crypto-ethereum-the-merge.html) Friday.

If you're just learning about web3, the Times article by David Yaffe-Bellany gives a thorough, layman-friendly overview of Ethereum's pending change to a new method for verifying transactions, dubbed the Merge, and why it matters.

And if you're *not* a web3 newbie, I'd argue articles like this are still worth your attention. They do a lot to improve the general public's awareness of blockchain technologies, and they help dispel the unfortunate perception among many normals that the industry is all about currency scams and short-term speculation.

Say what you will about the Merge, which has certainly generated its share of controversy, especially [among miners](https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2022/08/21/ethereum-miners-will-have-few-good-options-after-the-merge/) whose business models are about to be upended. But the intent behind the Merge is clearly to build something of real, lasting value.

It may ultimately fail at that goal, or it may succeed, as with any stab at true innovation. But I believe the attempt is always worth celebrating.
