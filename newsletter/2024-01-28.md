# Week in Review

- **BlackRock's exchange-traded fund** (ETF) for bitcoin is the first to [reach $2 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/26/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-first-to-reach-2b-in-aum/) in assets under management. But the token's spot price is still [in the red](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/01/26/why-is-everyone-suddenly-bearish-about-bitcoin/) since such funds gained SEC approval earllier this month. Much of the selling has come from investors [exiting the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/24/grayscales-gbtc-has-moved-more-than-100k-btc-to-exchange-since-spot-bitcoin-etf-launch/). (CoinDesk)

- **Meanwhile the U.S. stock markets' overall valuation is insanely concentrated around Big Tech.** Five of the S&P 500's 11 industry sectors, including energy, now carry a lower weighting in the benchmark index than a single major tech stock. Seven individual tech companies -- Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta -- now carry valuations over $1 trillion each. (A hat tip to the Wall Street Journal's Spencer Jakab, who [shared data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spencer-jakab-43b635b_oilandgas-technology-investing-activity-7155559846962995200-2W5Y/) on the index weightings via LinkedIn on Monday.)

# Odds & Ends

- **That's gonna leave a mark.** The classic '90s shoot-em-up game Doom is now running on the Dogecoin network. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/24/someone-just-put-90s-darling-game-doom-on-dogecoin/))

- **No fighting in the War Room!** Monday marks the 60th anniversary of the release of Stanley Kubrick's classic Cold War satire [Dr. Strangelove](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dr_strangelove). Considering that the world in 2024 is still threatened by an unreformed KGB agent, American politics is generally cracking up, and the number of other countries with nukes has mushroomed, I'd say this one is timely as ever.
