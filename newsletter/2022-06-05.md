**The token market** was [relatively quiet](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/03/bitcoin-weighed-down-by-34k-resistance-support-at-20k-25k/) for a second straight week. But fresh signs of fallout emerged among companies and institutional investors bracing to endure whatever remains to come of the broader bear market that erupted in early May:

- **TechCrunch reports** that venture investment in crypto startups [fell 38% in May](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/01/vc-funding-for-crypto-projects-fell-in-may-but-many-investors-remain-bullish/) compared to the previous month. But May's total of $4.2 billion in new new crypto investment still represented a  89% increase from a year ago.

- **Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss** announced that the company will [reduce its workforce by 10%](https://www.gemini.com/blog/a-message-from-cameron-and-tyler) due to the onset of a new "crypto winter."

- **FTX surpassed Coinbase** as the world's [second most-active crypto exchange](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/149654/ftx-surpassed-coinbase-as-second-biggest-centralized-crypto-exchange-in-may), behind only Binance, according to new data from The Block Research. FTX is also exploring a possible [derivatives partnership with Goldman Sachs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-ftx-derivatives-51654027703), according to Barron's.

- **Forbes magazine will call off its plan to go public** via a vehicle known as a special purpose acquisition company, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/business/media/forbes-public-spac-deal.html). SPACs have fallen out of favor on Wall Street  during the stock market's recent turmoil. For now, CoinDesk [reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/31/binance-supported-deal-for-forbes-to-go-public-via-spac-is-called-off-report/) it's unclear how the collapse of the Forbes offering might affect Binance's $200 million stake in Forbes, [announced in February](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/10/forbes-spac-binance-led-by-the-worlds-richest-crypto-billionaire-is-taking-a-200-million-stake-in-forbes-.html). But the crypto exchange said it is "continuing to review all possible options and look forward to working with the leadership team at Forbes in the months ahead."

- **The Ropsten test network**, a widely used tool among Ethereum app developers, is expected to [transition to proof-of-stake consensus](https://decrypt.co/101707/ethereum-ropsten-test-network-ready-merge-dress-rehearsal) later this week.

- **The Solana network** suffered a [“major outage”](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/solana-suffered-its-second-outage-in-a-month-sending-price-plunging.html) on Wednesday, its second such shutdown in a month. SOL tokens were down 12% for the week as a result. Ouch.

- **U.S. regulators charged a former OpenSea product manager with insider trading.** This is the [first such case](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme) they've brought concerning the market for non-fungible tokens.

- **Consensus 2022 starts on Thursday in Austin.** The CoinDesk sponsored [event](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/) went virtual the last two years due to COVID, but is now returning to in-person schmoozing. Congrats!

- **Sheryl Sandberg stepped down as Meta's chief operating officer.** Recode's Shirin Ghaffary perhaps summarized this news best, noting that Sandberg leaves a ["mixed legacy"](https://www.vox.com/recode/23151743/sheryl-sandberg-resigns-meta-facebook-lean-in) after 14 years at the social giant formerly known as Facebook. Yes, she helped make the company wildly profitable, grow its user base to more than two billion people, and was a tireless advocate for increasing representation of women in tech. On the other hand, she looked the other way while hate proliferated on Facebook and it became an effective conduit for disinformation that could yet prove sufficiently cancerous to end western democracy as we know it. So there's that.

- **Chipotle** said it will begin [accepting crypto payments](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/buy-burritos-with-bitcoin-chipotle-now-accepts-cryptocurrencies/). Surely, this will either end the bear market or get us all so stuffed with burritos that we don't care.
