- **E.T. just turned 40.** Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, which debuted June 11, 1982, passed a milestone anniversary this month. The event has of course sparked many appreciations and retrospectives in the press, including [this excellent one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/06/14/et-movie-anniversary/) from the Washington Post's A.A. Dowd. He notes what a rarity the thoughtful film is on the short list of all-time blockbusters. Dowd writes: *“'E.T.' sticks out especially against a canon of record-breaking testosterone fests. The only guns we see are wielded by the film’s bad guys, a faceless military presence that’s a far cry from the soldier-heroes that dominate so many of the other titles on the all-time charts. Spielberg, envisioning peaceful alien visitors again after 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' extols the opposite of a warfare mentality. Empathy is the film’s guiding philosophy."* Bravo.
