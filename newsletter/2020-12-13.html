      <p><strong>Wall Street thinks it just had a banner week of tech IPOs.</strong> But did it really?</p>

      <p>Three new names <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/12/investors-double-down-on-tech-stocks-in-massive-doordash-airbnb-ipos/">debuted</a> on the major stock exchanges: Airbnb, DoorDash, and C3.ai. They garnered the usual breathless coverage on cable news, investor curiosity, steadily rationed selling by underwriters, and early gains as a result. The three newcomers' combined market capitalization has already climbed <strong>above $150 billion</strong>.</p>

      <p>Sure, that's not too shabby. But let's put it in context of another number: The combined market cap of all crypto tokens has risen this year <strong>more than $360 billion</strong>, to a current total of $565 billion, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

      <p>My point is that blockchain is where both the real technical innovation and the value creation is in tech right now. It's not in people running glorified message boards to order Thai food or rent out their spare couch. (Which probably smells like stale beer anyway.)</p>

      <p>In other news:</p>



      <ul>


       <li><strong>The bitcoin ecosystem added some promising new parts.</strong> CoinSwap, a new tool to strengthen the privacy of bitcoin transactions, launched a public test on Tuesday. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yykd7d3v">https://tinyurl.com/yykd7d3v</a></em>) And Square announced committed $10 million to launch a new Bitcoin Clean Energy Investment Initiative to support adoption of renewables within the bitcoin world. (<em>Link: <a href-"https://tinyurl.com/y3s4cxqf">https://tinyurl.com/y3s4cxqf</a></em>) The effort seems aimed in particular at bitcoin mining, which has often been criticized as an environmentally unfriendly power hog.</li>


        <li><strong>Wall Street continued to ramp up its crypto buying.</strong> Bitwise announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund based on an index tracking ten popular tokens. The offering, which launched with $120 million in assets under management, makes it easier for retail investors to invest in crypto using a conventional stock brokerage account. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y44fo2of">https://tinyurl.com/y44fo2of</a></em>) Massachusetts Mutual, a 169-year-old life insurance company, announced it had made a $100 million investment in bitcoin and bought a minority stake in New York Digital Investment Group LLC. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5f9gydt">https://tinyurl.com/y5f9gydt</a></em>) And MicroStrategy, which set off the recent trend of companies holding bitcoin in their cash reserves, is now raising $400 million just to buy more of the token. (<em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y28we7k5">https://tinyurl.com/y28we7k5</a></em>) Despite the increased institutional interest, crypto prices were muted for the week, however. Bitcoin is up just 1.4% over the past 7 days, hampered by renewed worries of global recession due to coronavirus.</li>


 <li><strong>Brave released a new privacy-focused news reader.</strong> The new feature within the company's web browser does tailor headlines to users' interests. But it only uses data stored locally on the user's own machine, not collected to Brave's servers. (Gizmodo) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxjcx3nv">https://tinyurl.com/yxjcx3nv</a></em></li>




 <li><strong>Facebook was slapped with a new antitrust suit in the U.S.</strong> The Justice Department and a coalition of states want to break up the company by unwinding its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, deals the government says were part of a campaign to illegally crush competition. (Bloomberg) <em>Link:<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxu6y52c">https://tinyurl.com/yxu6y52c</a></em></li>



 <li><strong>Officials from the Group of Seven advanced economies reiterated their intention to regulate digital currencies.</strong> “There is strong support across the G7" to create rules for the cryptocurrency space, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement on Monday after hosting a virtual meeting of the international group. Separately, Germany's finance minister referred to Facebook's proposed stablecoin Diem in particular as "a wolf in sheep's clothing" threatening "the currency monopoly" that should properly remain in the hands of nations. Well! (Reuters) <em>Link:<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4wuwfgn">https://tinyurl.com/y4wuwfgn</a></em></li>

 <li><strong>Goldman Sachs said it will adopt J.P. Morgan Chase's recently launched crypto token.</strong> The banking giants will use the token, dubbed JPM Coin, for securities transactions known as repurchase agreements. (CoinDesk) <em>Link:<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3ce8nxs">https://tinyurl.com/y3ce8nxs</a></em></li>

 <li><strong>The dream of driverless cars could be about to crash</strong>, according to the Telegraph's James Titcomb. <em>Link:<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3ulo4v7">https://tinyurl.com/y3ulo4v7</a></em></li>

 <li><strong>South by Southwest has been canceled for the second year in a row</strong> due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sigh. (CNBC) <em>Link:<a href="https://tinyurl.com/tq9ez3r">https://tinyurl.com/tq9ez3r</a></em></li>

 <li><strong>Breakdancing just became an Olympic sport.</strong> I know this news is extremely off-topic. But it seemed worth mentioning. <em>Link:<a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxkoqo9h">https://tinyurl.com/yxkoqo9h</a></em></li>
