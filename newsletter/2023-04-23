**Let's play a game.** Admittedly, this one is more than a little nerdy. But here goes:

*Which form of money had the worst week?*

- **A new research report showed that the U.S. dollar's share** of global cash reserves [fell to 47%](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/dollar-dominance-global-reserves-china-euro-russia-ukraine-war-greenback-2023-4) in 2022, down eight percentage points due largely to the effect of sanctions against Russia. The greenback's share of global reserves has been eroding for about two decades. But the 8-point drop in 2022 was a decline 10 times greater than the norm over that timeframe, according to Eurizon SLJ Asset Management.

- **Toronto's Pearson airport** suffered a [$15 million gold heist](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/canada-gold-heist-police-investigating-20m-of-high-value-cargo-stolen-from-toronto-airport) that sounds like the plot of the next Ocean's Eleven sequel.

- **Bitcoin suffered a two-day swoon** that left it down nearly 9% on the week, according to data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/). A mix of factors [contributed](https://247wallst.com/investing/2023/04/21/bitcoin-finds-footing-just-above-28k-after-2-day-drop/) to the pullback, but BTC is still up nearly 70% for the year.

Offhand, I'd vote for USD as the worst for wear here and bitcoin the least, as its problems seem to be the most easily reversible. But hey... That's just my two cents as someone who (full disclosure) is long bitcoin.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **The European Union** just became the first major jurisdiction in the world to [introduce a comprehensive crypto law](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/20/eu-parliament-approves-crypto-licensing-funds-transfer-rules/), CoinDesk reports. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and other high-profile crypto founders [hailed the new legislation](https://www.theblock.co/post/227596/binances-cz-gemini-crypto-sec-eu-mica) passed by the European Parliament, which now awaits approval by individual EU member states.

- **In the U.S.,** a congressional panel [questioned Chairman Gary Gensler](https://www.theblock.co/post/226877/gensler-sec-congress-hearing-crypto) about the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent actions against crypto companies under traditional financial-industry regulations, and about what new, modern rules for crypto should look like. Gensler demurred when asked point-blank whether ether is a security.

- **Venture investment in web3** fell 82% in the first quarter compared to the year-ago period, [according to Crunchbase](https://news.crunchbase.com/web3/vc-backed-funding-drops-q1-2023/).

- **Intel is ending** its line of chips for bitcoin miners, citing the need to [cut costs](https://www.theblock.co/post/226903/intel-bitcoin-mining-chip-business-ends). Ouch.  

- **Forbes reports** that Bhutan may have quietly become the first country to invest a portion of its sovereign wealth portfolio [in bitcoin](https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2023/04/15/the-tiny-kingdom-of-bhutan-secretly-held-millions-of-dollars-in-cryptocurrency/).

- **The Bored Ape Yacht Club** won a [federal copyright lawsuit](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/22/judge-rules-bored-ape-yacht-club-ripoff-nfts-violated-yuga-copyright/) against the issuer of non-fungible tokens with images similar to its own.

- **So are they still angry?** Sega acquired Rovio, maker of the popular Angry Birds games, [for $775 million](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23686155/sega-sammy-acquires-rovio-angry-birds-developer-mobile-games). 

- **Things you learn only on Twitter:** A squirrel-proof bird feeder is truly something to [behold in action](https://twitter.com/thegardengears/status/1649080618091675649).
