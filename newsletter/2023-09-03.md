# Post-Grayscale, what next for bitcoin?
## #Web3Weekly: Aug. 27 to Sept. 2, 2023

((News hook... Grayscale decision. Yadda yadda yadda...))

((Effects on investor interest...))

((Question is the cause and effect. Did the availability of the GLD fimd draw in investors who otherwise wouldn't have participated in gold? Or did GLD merely track what would've happened anyway due to other factors that would've helped gold, like major economic crises that undermined traditional investments in 2008 and 2020?))

((It's hard to say even now. But let it suffice that the availability of an ETF certainly didn't hurt matters for gold's commodity price.))

((It's hard to overstate how inconvenient it was for small investors to get into gold prior to GLD. There were various attempts at e-gold...))

((No innovation has ever revived gold's role as money for daily payments.))

((Crypto's UI problem))

((New trust will almost inevitably become a whale. However, it will be the most transparent, market-neutral whale we've ever seen. This should in turn diminish slightly the power of the more common loud-mouthed, manipulative species of bitcoin whale we're all more accustomed to seeing, which is just fine by me.))

Daniel Kuhn for CoinDesk (https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/08/29/the-real-reasons-the-grayscale-bitcoin-etf-decision-matters/)

"...The U.S. Court of Appeals has shown that the SEC is not the ultimate arbiter of crypto. The agency does not necessarily or automatically get the final word; the U.S. court system and better yet Congress can also offer legal interpretations. This is significant because of the boom and bluster coming out of SEC Chair Gary Gensler since he took office, and his willingness to say all of crypto – except bitcoin – is under the agency's remit."

"In reality, there are major overhanging questions as to whether the SEC has proper jurisdiction over digital assets. This is one of the main points of contention discussed in the much-watched Lummis-Gillibrand “Responsible Financial Innovation” bill moving through Congress, which emphasizes crypto’s “commodity-like” attributes and so would raise up the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a regulator."

There's no way around this: The CFTC is a more permissive regulator than the SEC. It's also generally viewed like a little brother, although it's ostensibly an equal peer.

Philosophical difference: The SEC is more strictly proscriptive in its approach whereas the CFTC is more principle-based.

- **Patience pays.** According to [a new whitepaper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.bitwiseinvestments.com/Research/Bitcoins-Role-in-a-Traditional-Portfolio-08-2023.pdf) by fund manager Bitwise, a conservative allocation of bitcoin (2.5%) would have improved the three-year return of a traditional portfolio comprising 60% stocks and 40% bonds in *every* three-year period going back to 2014. The strategy also was effective in 90% of two-year periods and 70% of one-year periods studied.

- **A federal judge in the U.S. ruled that Ethereum** is a commodity in a new decision favoring Uniswap over investors suing the platform for alleged securities law violations. In America, regulation of commodities is largely separated from oversight of securities, so crypto projects generally try to avoid falling into the latter category.
