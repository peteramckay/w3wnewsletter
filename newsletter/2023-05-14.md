**Imagine a couple of technologies that:**

- Are fully open source, including *publicly available, transparent algorithms.* No secret sauce working contrary to users' privacy, a shared sense of objective truth, and other things [necessary to modern society](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/27/cathy-oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction-algorithms-big-data) as we know it.

- Are relatively untouched by -- and definitely not controlled by -- the oligarchy of [massive public U.S. tech companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/faang-stocks-mamaa/) that otherwise dominate everyone's experience of the internet.

- Carry a combined market valuation north of $700 billion anyway.

These are all characteristics of the two biggest blockchain networks, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which constitute a combined 65% of the global crypto market.

In my opinion, they are also reasons we should ultimately be rooting for these chains (and other open ones like them) to win, even if there are some missteps along the way. We generally need our technology to look more like the above list, to make the internet truly work for the greater good like it's supposed to.

To put it a different way: We don't just need to regulate or cajole Big Tech to do better. We need alternatives that cut them out altogether.
