**Imagine a couple of technologies that:**

- Are fully open source, including *publicly available, transparent algorithms.* No secret sauce working contrary to users' privacy, a shared sense of objective truth, and other things [necessary for modern society](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/27/cathy-oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction-algorithms-big-data) as we know it to continue.

- Are relatively untouched by -- and definitely not controlled by -- the oligarchy of [massive public U.S. tech companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/faang-stocks-mamaa/) that otherwise dominate everyone's experience of the internet.

- Carry a combined market valuation north of $700 billion regardless.

These are actual characteristics of the two biggest blockchain networks, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which constitute a combined 65% of the global crypto market. Right now. Even with the global token market still well below its all-time high of a $3 trillion valuation set in late 2021.

These are real successes -- ones that are generally overlooked, in my opinion. Between the obsession with daily swings in the token market and crypto folks' propensity to squabble about differences between their favorite chains, it's easy to lose sight of this bigger picture. 

Ultimately, it shouldn't be about "my chain is better than your chain." It's about replacing the current shit that the masses of people are actually using, made by a shitty oligarchy based in a single country. That's what it will take to truly make a better internet for everyone.

On to the week's notable headlines:

- **Token prices suffered a broad pullback,** hurt by a strengthening U.S. dollar. Bitcoin posted a [weekly decline](https://decrypt.co/140053/this-week-in-coins-bitcoin-and-ethereum-lead-market-pullback-as-dollar-rises) of 7%. The price correlation between BTC and ETH also tumbled to [an 18-month low](https://www.theblock.co/post/230718/bitcoin-ether-price-correlation). Several memecoins were sharply lower, including a Pepe the Frog coin that tumbled [more than 60%](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/12/bitcoin-loses-10-on-the-week-as-memecoins-tumble/).

- **The recent introduction of non-fungible tokens** on the Bitcoin network is slowing transaction confirmations broadly and [pushing fees higher](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/bitcoins-brc-20-explosion-sends-users-scrambling-for-options-including-lightning/). That's led to an increasingly heated debate pitting NFT issuers against Bitcoin developers and investors who want the platform to remain [strictly a monetary network](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/12/among-bitcoin-developers-debate-is-raging-over-whether-to-censor-ordinals-brc-20s/).

- **Tether reported** a [$1.5 billion profit](https://www.theblock.co/post/230241/tether-attestation-report-q1-2023) in the first quarter, more than double the previous period.

- **Binance said** it will [cease operations in Canada](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1657099651210969088) due to what it views as overly restrictive new regulations.
