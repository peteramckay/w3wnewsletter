**Imagine a couple of technologies that:**

- Are fully open source, including *publicly available, transparent algorithms.* No secret sauce working contrary to users' privacy, a shared sense of objective truth, and other things [necessary for modern society](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/27/cathy-oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction-algorithms-big-data) as we know it to continue.

- Are relatively untouched by -- and definitely not controlled by -- the oligarchy of [massive public U.S. tech companies](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/faang-stocks-mamaa/) that otherwise dominate everyone's experience of the internet.

- Carry a combined market valuation north of $700 billion regardless.

These are actual characteristics of the two biggest blockchain networks, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which constitute a combined 65% of the global crypto market. Right now. Even with the token market still well below its all-time high set in late 2021, when global crypto valuation topped $3 trillion.

In my opinion, the above bullet points are also reasons we should ultimately be rooting for public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum to win, even if there are some missteps along the way. We generally need our technology to look more like the above list, to make the internet truly work for the greater good like it's supposed to.

On to the week's notable headlines:

- **Token prices suffered a broad pullback.** Bitcoin posted a [weekly decline](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/12/bitcoin-loses-10-on-the-week-as-memecoins-tumble/) of 10% through late Friday trading, hurt by continued worries about the U.S. regulatory picture. The price correlation between BTC and ETH also tumbled to [an 18-month low](https://www.theblock.co/post/230718/bitcoin-ether-price-correlation). Several memecoins were sharply lower, including a Pepe the Frog coin that tumbled [more than 60%](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/05/12/bitcoin-loses-10-on-the-week-as-memecoins-tumble/).

- **The recent introduction of non-fungible tokens** on the Bitcoin network is slowing transaction confirmations broadly. That's led to an increasingly heated debate pitting NFT issuers against Bitcoin developers and investors who want the platform to remain strictly a monetary network. CoinDesk reports that
