The week's notable headlines:

- **FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's trial** on federal fraud charges began in New York. The biggest early development was testimony Thursday and Friday by former FTX executive Gary Wang. He said Bankman-Fried was fully aware that $8 billion in customer money had been moved from FTX to Alameda Research, a hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/technology/gary-wang-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-trial.html))

- **New challenges for Ethereum?** JPMorgan analysts said in a new research report that the number-two network has [become more centralized](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/06/ethereum-has-become-more-centralized-since-the-merge-and-shanghai-upgrades-jpmorgan/) following its recent transition to a proof-of-stake algorithm for verifying transactions and its upgrade to enable "liquid" trading of staked tokens. Separately, Bitcoinist reported on new metrics showing that the Tron network has [more daily active addresses](https://bitcoinist.com/tron-daily-active-addresses-ethereum/) than Ethereum, boosted largely by stablecoin transactions.

- **Global market vaulation of stablecoins** has fallen for 18 straight months, down 35% to $124 billion as of yesterday. A mix of factors is driving the slowdown, including reduced appetite for crypto among retail investors and higher interest rates on conventional bank deposits.

- **More layoffs:** Crypto wallet maker [Ledger](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/05/crypto-custody-firm-ledger-cuts-12-of-staff/), NFT issuer [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://decrypt.co/200455/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-creator-yuga-labs-confirms-layoffs), and research firm [Chainalysis](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/10/03/blockchain-analytics-firm-chainalysis-cuts-15-staff/ ) all announced staff cuts. Sigh...

- **U.S. broadcast regulators levied the first-ever fine for space junk.** The Federal Communications Commission leveled a $150,000 penalty against TV provider Dish for failing to move one of its satellites into a safe orbit. The decision could ignite a market for services to dispose of old man-made devices in space. ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/05/1080999/first-space-junk-fine/))
