Bitcoin is now the number-two blockchain network for non-fungible tokens, (Solana) according to the site NFT Culture. https://www.nftculture.com/nft-news/bitcoin-emerges-as-second-largest-nft-blockchain-challenging-ethereums-dominance/ | NFT generation has tripled on the Bitcoin blockchain since May. https://decrypt.co/142415/passing-fad-bitcoin-ordinals-inscriptions-hit-new-milestone | A new dollar-pegged stablecoin is coming to the Bitcoin network. https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/25/bitcoins-hot-ordinals-economy-is-getting-a-dollar-backed-stablecoin/



**When I covered the stock market for the Wall Street Journal,** we would often talk about [home bias](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/homebias.asp). That is, the well-documented tendency of investors in a country to buy shares of companies based in the same country. <!-- Quote from Investopedia about lack of logic 

I've since come to believe there may be a form of home bias among tech users as well, and that it carries big implications for web3 in particular.
