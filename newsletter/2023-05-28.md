**There is no question** that Bicoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto intended it as an "electronic cash system." The term is right there in the title of [his whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) from 2008.

So how did the Bitcoin network end up storing artwork like [this image](https://www.ordinalhub.com/inscription/6499bb011513828628510ba9e1f4c80a169ece748f72b79cabc32d96b6b4e17fi0) of what appears to be a zombie samurai?

Enter [Ordinals](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-ordinals-an-overview-of-bitcoin-nfts), a protocol launched in January 2023 that allows someone to turn the smallest tradeable unit of a bitcoin, called a satoshi, into a non-fungible token. This is done by inscribing additional information onto that satoshi using Bitcoin's shared ledger, stuff beyond the purely transaction-related data that capital-s Satoshi originally envisioned.

What's ensued since the launch of Ordinals is either pure awesomeness or utter sacrilege, depending on your view of Bitcoin. Its chain is now the [number-two venue](https://www.nftculture.com/nft-news/bitcoin-emerges-as-second-largest-nft-blockchain-challenging-ethereums-dominance/) for NFT activity overall, behind only Ethereum and ahead of earlier contenders like Solana. But that's meant slower traffic and [higher fees](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64182b5f2d80720f9caa20ad/) on the Bitcoin network, infuriating "traditional" users who just want to [use BTC as money](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ordinal-problems-solved-by-layer-2).

Even Peter Schiff, a gold-focused money manager and vocal bitcoin critic, unveiled a new [Ordinals artwork collection](https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1662210584178475008) on Friday, created in partnership with an artist who goes my Market Price. (Subtle!)

Meanwhile, the startup Stably on Monday begain [issuing a dollar-backed stablecoin](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/25/bitcoins-hot-ordinals-economy-is-getting-a-dollar-backed-stablecoin/) using Ordinals. So now we effectively have U.S. dollars trading on the Bitcoin network.

That *definitely* isn't something Satoshi ever intended. But I suspect many more  such surprises are yet to come.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **WTF is going on with Tether?** The data firm Kaiko notes that the popular stablecoin's market valuation is [nearing a record](https://research.kaiko.com/insights/why-is-tethers-market-cap-approaching-all-time-highs) over $80 billion even though trading volume has been relatively weak in 2023. Decrypt [reports](https://decrypt.co/142036/tether-market-cap-edges-toward-all-time-high-minting-tron-surges) that rising usage of Tether on the Tron network for decentralized finance apps may be driving the valuation increase. Separately, Tether's parent company recently [announced](https://www.theblock.co/post/231156/tether-bitcoin-investments-profits) it is shifting its reserve strategy away from purchases of U.S. government debt and toward crypto, including bitcoin.

- **Bitcoinist reports** that Ethereum "whales" have [accumulated $9 billion in ETH](https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-whales-on-the-rise-acquires-billion-eth/) so far this year, spurred in part by the network's transition to a new Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. The report is based on data from the analytics firm IntoTheBlock, which [defines an ETH "whale"](https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1661995894667984896) as any single wallet that controls more than 0.1% of token supply.
