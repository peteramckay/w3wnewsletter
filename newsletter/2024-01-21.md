**I think it's fair to say that the category of stuff** the Chinese Communist Party, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, and uber-liberal U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren all agree on is vanishingly small. If you notice something that falls into it, probably a good idea to be intrigued, at least. Perhaps even deeply concerned.

Which brings us to the topic of banning cryptocurrency outright.

The Wall Street Journal ran a [fascinating story](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/laundromats-and-vpns-how-chinas-crypto-traders-are-evading-the-rules-8511ebe8?st=0v89k98pxrxmia9&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) Friday on crypto trading in China. As reporters Elaine Yu and Weilun Soon note, the country has officially banned all crypto trading and mining since 2021, officially making China one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the world regarding crypto.

Unofficially, small investors in China have found all sorts of workarounds to the ban, executing as much as $90 billion a month in crypto trading volume recently. As the Journal explains:

*Many users in the country still have accounts at crypto exchanges based outside China, which they created before the trading ban. They can often access these accounts through virtual private networks, which allow internet users to mask their locations, according to people familiar with the matter. Some crypto traders in the country can access their accounts even without using a VPN, some of the people said...*

*Traders wanting to buy bitcoin, tether or other cryptocurrencies also use social-media apps such as WeChat and Telegram after getting referrals from their friends, according to people in the country. Dedicated groups on these platforms allow buyers and sellers to find each other without the need for an exchange to match them.*

*Chinese crypto traders also use some old-fashioned methods to flout the rules. These include meetings in public places, where they exchange addresses of crypto wallets, according to people with knowledge of these trades. Traders either swap crypto directly, pay in cash or arrange bank transfers.*

Further on, the story also points out that China does still allow some on-chain activity, such as building applications and exchanging digital collectibles. The country's central bank is even working on its own official digital currency.

In other words, private blockchain networks that can be supervised by the government are fine. What the CCP really has a jones for is digital currencies like bitcoin changing hands over *open, public networks*.

The Journal doesn't say this part, but I would add that there's another important word we could use to describe such networks: They're inherently small-d *democratic.*

It's thus no coincidence that tyrants like the CCP hate open, public networks. The open internet itself also fits this description, and we've seen for decades how CCP has [tried to censor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) that network as well, with mixed results. For people building and using public blockchains, the party's disdain should really be a badge of honor.

We should also find it odd that some people want a crypto ban similar to China's imposed in a Western democracy like the U.S. As Dimon flatly told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee last month, when tossed a softball question by Warren regarding crypto:

["If I was the government, I'd close it down."](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/12/06/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-and-sen-elizabeth-warren-team-up-to-bash-crypto/)

Warren's response: "OK!"

It's unlikely she could get such a sweeping law passed, mind you. But it's telling to see such a mindset on display. Why should this be the direction America wants to go? 

# Week in Review

- **Bitcoin's spot price** continued to sag, down 3%, in the first full week of trading since U.S. regulators approved exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding the token on investors' behalf. Pre-ETF bitcoin holders have essentially been taking profits, selling to the listed funds as they ramp up daily trading activity and assets.

- **After just seven days of trading on U.S. stock exchanges,** the new bitcoin funds' total valuation has now risen above $30 billion. That makes them the largest category of commodity-backed ETFs except for those tracking gold. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/18/bitcoin-instantly-topped-silver-in-etf-market-and-trails-only-gold-among-commodities/))

- **The Wall Street Journal's Eric Wallerstein** points out that U.S. investors now hold [$8.8 trillion in cash](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/the-8-8-trillion-cash-pile-that-has-stock-market-bulls-salivating-0a1b4a8c?st=127esjfhcdvf5ad&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) that could come off the sidelines if the Federal Reserve begins to cut interest rates this year, as expected. Stocks and crypto could benefit in such a scenario.

- **Small investors in China** are finding creative workarounds to the country's outright ban on crypto trading. Chinese traders received a net $86 billion of cash from cryptocurrency activity between July 2022 and June 2023, much of it traded over virtual private networks or in peer-to-peer transactions conducted in cafes and laundromats.
