# Meet the "godfather of AI"
## #Web3Weekly: Aug. 13-19, 2023

**Unless you live under a rock,** I'm sure you've noticed the press has spilled *a lot* of ink on artificial intelligence lately. For better or worse, much of it has been highly speculative regarding AI-fueled scenarios that may be on the way soon, stuff straight out of [a sci-fi movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSIKBliboIo).

Perhaps the most informative sub-genre of all this AI coverage comprises interviews with Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering computer science professor who's studied neural networks for more than 40 years. In particular, there was a flurry of news stories about Hinton this spring, when he [resigned his job at Google](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65452940) so he could speak more freely about potential AI risks.

He's since given dozens of media interviews, spoken at conferences on AI, and so forth, with much of that activity freely [viewable on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=geoffrey+hinton). Hinton speaks from deep firsthand experience with AI and, when he does veer into speculation, it's at least the best *informed* guess about the future we can possibly get.

If I had to pick just one media hit of Hinton's as my own favorite, it would be [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9RWTMNnvi4) with Bloomberg News. The 8-minute piece piece focuses on who Hinton is, how he got interested in AI in the first place, and why his early work in the field was so vital to everything that's come into fruition since.

In other words, it's great context to his more recent remarks -- and to other people's pontificating about AI as well. Definitely worth sharing as part of the series I've been doing in the newsletter this summer highlighting videos about the basics of web3.

[ICYMI](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=icymi) here are my earlier picks in the series as well:

- Wired magazine's explainer [Wired magazine's explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0&t=49s) of "what is blockchain," tailored so even a five-year old can understand it.

- [Author Ben Mezrich telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN96Dgih3gI) the "making of" backstory behind his book [Bitcoin Billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Billionaires-Genius-Betrayal-Redemption/dp/1250217741/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1), a classic history of the crypto market's early days.

- On Ethereum's recent eighth anniversary, Fortune paused to discuss the network's past, present, and future. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKmbxd4MQmk&t=618s). <!-- In less than 15 minutes, reporter Rosemarie Miller covers a *lot* of ground about the platform's history and its future through her chat with blockchain entrepreneur Jamiel Shiekh. -->

- Journalist Johnny Harris does a great job explaining what non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz9zw7-_vhM).

_**That's it for now! Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_
