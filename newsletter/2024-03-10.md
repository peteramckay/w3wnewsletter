**Everyone is flat wrong about bitcoin at some point.** The real question is whether a person admits it and adjusts accordingly, or do they just keep doubling down either rhetorically or (God forbid) by betting real money.

It's possible to be wrong in either direction for prices, by the way. Given bitcoin's long-term strength, it's a way more common mistake to be too bearish. Early on, I was even [guilty of this myself](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/) covering markets for Vice News, lo those two crypto winters ago.

But being too bullish is certainly possible as well for some people, including many, many predictions with specific short-term timeframes and specific, astronomical price targets that have turned out to be [demonstrably wrong](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/).









TKTKTKTK. You were wrong.








The majority , myself included.

Lede item. Should run ~450 words.

The COVID pandemic was perhaps as formative for crypto as 2008's crisis.

Inflation...

The dollar is wreaking havoc in many of the nearly 200 countries that *aren't* the United States. It's making the world a more unstable place.

The COVID pandemic was two crises in one: A humanitarian disaster, and a financial disaster.

If you just take the financial piece, it's worse than 2008.

Bitcoin was famously born in a crisis.

Formative for crypto in a way that may be as important.

Greater skepticism of fiat. One thing versus another.

The crisis here makes the one I covered in 2008 look like a picnic.

Arkham believes Tesla holds around 11,500 BTC worth approximately $770 million, while SpaceX controls about 8,300 BTC valued at around $550 million. The article notes these holdings match financial disclosures previously made by the two companies regarding their Bitcoin purchases. https://www.theblock.co/post/281128/arkham-claims-to-identify-tesla-spacex-bitcoin-addresses

- The largest Bitcoin ordinal inscription, called the Runestone, is currently being auctioned off with the highest bid at 0.26 BTC (~$17,261). All proceeds from the auction will go towards covering network fees for an upcoming airdrop of the Runestone to over 112,000 Bitcoin addresses. This record-setting Runestone inscription was carved into the largest block ever mined on the Bitcoin blockchain. https://decrypt.co/220515/bitcoin-ordinals-runestone-auction-ahead-of-airdrop

- On March 13, Ethereum will undergo the Dencun upgrade, marking the first step in its rollup-centric roadmap. This upgrade will enable the network to function as a proper database for layer-2 blockchains, allowing them to store data more efficiently and cheaply. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, this improvement could potentially lead to near-zero transaction fees for layer-2 users, attracting more users and expanding Ethereum's total addressable market. However, in the short term, users on the base Ethereum blockchain may not experience direct positive effects from this upgrade. https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/07/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-could-mean-near-zero-fees-for-layer-2-blockchains-fidelity-digital-assets/
