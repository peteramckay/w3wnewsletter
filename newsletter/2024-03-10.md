**Everyone is flat wrong about bitcoin at some point.** The real question is whether a person admits it and adjusts accordingly, or do they just keep doubling down either rhetorically or (God forbid) by betting real money.

It's possible to be wrong in either direction for prices, by the way. Given bitcoin's long-term strength, it's a way more common mistake to be too bearish. Early on, I was even [guilty of this myself](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/) covering markets for Vice News, lo those two crypto winters ago.

But being too bullish is certainly possible as well in some cases, including many, many predictions with specific short-term timeframes and specific, astronomical price targets that have turned out to be [demonstrably wrong](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/).

Of course, this is all front of mind right now because bitcoin touched fresh [all-time highs](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/bitcoin-rises-record-high-over-70000-2024-03-08/) above $70,000 last week. Heading into Monday's trading, the token is still within a few hundred dollars of that milestone and now carries a market capitalization near $1.4 trillion -- a valuation roughly equivalent to that of the global supply of [silver bullion](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Bitcoin-market-cap-approaches-silver-with-latest-rally).

In telling the story of this historic rally, the press has offered some interesting examples of past bitcoin market calls that didn't work out -- and how the issuers of those calls have responded.

Clearly in the "make adjustments as needed" school is Larry Fink, CEO of the giant hedge fund BlackRock Investments. The Wall Street Journal just published [a story](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-bitcoin-made-a-believer-out-of-blackrock-abebb140?st=971uegs09wu0qk8&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about how Fink went from being a staunch bitcoin skeptic in 2017 to jumping in with both feet, pushing BlackRock to offer an exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding bitcoin on investors' behalf.

Several competitors followed suit, but BlackRock's ETF has emerged as the biggest of the bunch since bitcoin funds were approved by U.S. regulators in January. In just the first few months of trading, BlackRock's fund has reportedly acquired [almost 200,000 BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-nears-200k-125311082.html), about $14 billion worth.

The Journal notes BlackRock has begun dabbling in other corners of the token market as  well. The firm has invested in stablecoin issuer Circle, partnered with Coinbase to offer clients custodial services for a variety of digital assets, and proposed an ether ETF to follow up on the bitcoin funds' success.

Unfortunately, in the "double down no matter what" school of thought regarding busted bitcoin calls is Gilad Edelman, a senior editor at The Atlantic. In a [new essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/crypto-bitcoin-market-strength/677643/) published Tuesday, he attempted to explain "why crypto just won't die."

The piece starts off promisingly enough, in that Edelman correctly identifies some major fundamental factors in the market lately. But then it goes off the rails with a deceptively dumbass rhetorical question:

*The present surge has two immediate causes. The first is the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs reluctant decision to begin approving bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which has opened the sector to traditional financial institutions and given it a new sheen of legitimacy. The second is that bitcoin is approaching one of its periodic ‚Äúhalvings‚Äù‚Äîmoments, programmed into its source code, when the rate of new bitcoin production gets cut by 50 percent, which reliably causes demand to jump. But neither of these factors explains the deeper mystery: How is crypto even still a thing?*

From there, Edelman essentially goes through a bunch of contortions to continue to believe what he previously believed about crypto anyway, despite new information to the contrary.

I'll let you click through to read [the whole trainwreck](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/crypto-bitcoin-market-strength/677643/) for yourself, if you dare. But let it suffice that a few possibles explanations for crypto's survival that the author somehow never considers include:

- Entrepreneurs are still building new services and products on top of open networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, trying to create real value for users. Because not everyone is Sam Bankman-Fried. In fact, the vast majority aren't.

- At the previous peak in late 2021, the global crypto market was worth $3 trillion. At the post-crash lows a little over a year later, it was still worth *about $800 billion*. That's what "dead" supposedly looks like? Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that, even in crypto's worst days, even after a ton of market value had indeed been destroyed, there was still a quite viable foundation to build a comeback upon. It was hiding in plain sight all along, dude.

- Maybe Edelman and his colleagues (gasp!) simply missed a few important things about the last market cycle.

But hey. What can you do about that last one in particular? Happens to everyone at some point, right?

# Week in Review

- **The Ethereum network is expected to roll out its Dencun upgrade this week.** In particular, this new version of the platform's software is expected to help layer-2 blockchains store data more efficiently and cheaply. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/07/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-could-mean-near-zero-fees-for-layer-2-blockchains-fidelity-digital-assets/))

- **In an interview with Bloomberg TV,** Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler [declined to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcHBwFKzVHY) whether he considers ether a security. Hmmm...

- **Investors have poured over $5 billion** into liquid staking tokens. On networks that use a "proof of stake" method for confirming transactions, such tokens allow holders to earn additional yield while still providing computing capacity to the platform. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/06/liquid-restaking-tokens-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter/))

- **Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence** says they have identified Bitcoin wallet addresses belonging to Tesla and SpaceX. Arkham estimates Tesla holds 11,500 BTC worth $770 million, while SpaceX controls about 8,300 BTC valued around $550 million. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/281128/arkham-claims-to-identify-tesla-spacex-bitcoin-addresses))

- **The U.S. and South Korea** are competing in Montenegro's courts to win custody and be first to extradite Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to face fraud charges. So far, South Korea has the upper hand. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/220761/us-challenge-extradition-terra-do-kwon-south-korea))

- **Daren Firestone,** a lawyer who represents whistleblowers at crypto companies, says the use cases for many ostensibly AI-related tokens like FET and Worldcoin are unclear except to raise money for the startups issuing them. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/04/aicrypto-trouble/))

- **Fairshake,** a crypto-focused political action committee, is expected to donate millions to candiates for U.S. Senate in Ohio and Montana this November. The outcome of those races is crucial to determining which party has a majority in the closely divided Senate. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/08/us/politics/crypto-super-pac-senate-oh-mt.html))

- **Proposed legislation in Arizona's legislature** would encourage the U.S. state's public pension plans to invest in exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/220493/bitcoin-etf-state-retirement-system-pension-government-workers))

# Odds & Ends

- **China faces tough policy choices** in trying to revive the country's flagging economy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-boom-is-overbeijing-is-making-it-worse-b82f8ec1?st=g2refpjh4vr5ok0&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **Mexico dumped daylight saving time,** as any country that is even half-sane should in this twenty-first century. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/03/08/daylight-saving-time-debate-mexico-end/))

- **This is definitely *not* the business we have chosen.** In cybersecurity expert Ari Juels' new crime novel, someone uses a smart contract to [put out a hit](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/01/whats-at-the-intersection-of-crypto-and-ai-perhaps-murder/) on the protagonist. Yikes.
