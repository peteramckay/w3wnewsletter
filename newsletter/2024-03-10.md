# Week in Review

- **Bitcoin briefly traded at a new all-time high Tuesday.** <!-- Update Friday https://www.theblock.co/post/280590/bitcoin-investment-vehicles-1-million-btc-67-billion-usd | https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/05/bitcoin-soars-to-new-all-time-high-above-69k/ -->

- This article discusses claims by blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence that they have identified the Bitcoin wallet addresses belonging to Tesla and SpaceX. Arkham believes Tesla holds around 11,500 BTC worth approximately $770 million, while SpaceX controls about 8,300 BTC valued at around $550 million. The article notes these holdings match financial disclosures previously made by the two companies regarding their Bitcoin purchases. https://www.theblock.co/post/281128/arkham-claims-to-identify-tesla-spacex-bitcoin-addresses

- The largest Bitcoin ordinal inscription, called the Runestone, is currently being auctioned off with the highest bid at 0.26 BTC (~$17,261). All proceeds from the auction will go towards covering network fees for an upcoming airdrop of the Runestone to over 112,000 Bitcoin addresses. This record-setting Runestone inscription was carved into the largest block ever mined on the Bitcoin blockchain. https://decrypt.co/220515/bitcoin-ordinals-runestone-auction-ahead-of-airdrop

- On March 13, Ethereum will undergo the Dencun upgrade, marking the first step in its rollup-centric roadmap. This upgrade will enable the network to function as a proper database for layer-2 blockchains, allowing them to store data more efficiently and cheaply. According to Fidelity Digital Assets, this improvement could potentially lead to near-zero transaction fees for layer-2 users, attracting more users and expanding Ethereum's total addressable market. However, in the short term, users on the base Ethereum blockchain may not experience direct positive effects from this upgrade. https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/07/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-could-mean-near-zero-fees-for-layer-2-blockchains-fidelity-digital-assets/

- SEC Chair Gary Gensler refused to say whether the SEC considers Ethereum a security and deferred the decision on spot Ethereum ETF applications again. https://decrypt.co/220545/sec-chair-gary-gensler-ethereum-security

- **Solana update:** <!-- New 2-year high + possible corporate deal. Update Friday. Some early links: https://decrypt.co/220543/solana-2-year-high-bonk-wif-trading-volume | https://decrypt.co/220563/solana-up-13-pantera-buying-ftx-sol -->

- Investors have poured over $5 billion into liquid staking tokens. <!-- Need a second explanatory sentence here. --> https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/06/liquid-restaking-tokens-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter/

- **Win some, lose some:** Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon [won a court appeal](https://www.theblock.co/post/280635/do-kwon-us-extradition-revoked) in Montenegro to avoid being extradited to the U.S. to face fraud charges. But then he [lost a separate case](https://www.theblock.co/post/281138/do-kwon-to-be-extradited-to-south-korea-after-court-reverses-extradition-to-us) regarding extradition to South Korea and will now be sent there instead.

- **Daren Firestone,** a lawyer who represents whistleblowers at crypto companies, says the use cases for many ostensibly AI-related tokens like FET and Worldcoin are unclear except to raise money for the startups issuing them. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/04/aicrypto-trouble/))

- Proposed legislation in Arizona's legislature would encourage the U.S. state's public pension plans to invest in exchange-traded funds holding bitcoin. https://decrypt.co/220493/bitcoin-etf-state-retirement-system-pension-government-workers

# Odds & Ends

- **China faces tough policy choices** in trying to revive the country's flagging economy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-boom-is-overbeijing-is-making-it-worse-b82f8ec1?st=g2refpjh4vr5ok0&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **This is definitely *not* the business we have chosen.** In cybersecurity expert Ari Juels' new crime novel, someone uses a smart contract to [put out a hit](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/01/whats-at-the-intersection-of-crypto-and-ai-perhaps-murder/) on the protagonist. Yikes.
