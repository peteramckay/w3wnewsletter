# Week in Review

<!-- Prompt: Leo, please summarize the news article in this browser tab. I'm looking for a paragraph of 2-3 conversational sentences, suitable to use in a newsletter I'm working on. -->

- **Bitcoin briefly traded at a new all-time high Tuesday.** <!-- Update Friday https://www.theblock.co/post/280590/bitcoin-investment-vehicles-1-million-btc-67-billion-usd | https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/05/bitcoin-soars-to-new-all-time-high-above-69k/ -->

- **Daren Firestone,** a lawyer who represents whistleblowers at crypto companies, says the use cases for many ostensibly AI-related tokens like FET and Worldcoin are unclear except to raise money for the startups issuing them. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/04/aicrypto-trouble/))

- **Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon won a court appeal** in Montenegro to avoid being extradited to the U.S. to face fraud charges. Prosecutors' request will now return to a lower court to be re-heard. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/280635/do-kwon-us-extradition-revoked))  

# Odds & Ends

- **China faces tough policy choices** in trying to revive the country's flagging economy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-boom-is-overbeijing-is-making-it-worse-b82f8ec1?st=g2refpjh4vr5ok0&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **This is definitely *not* the business we have chosen.** In cybersecurity expert Ari Juels' new crime novel, someone uses a smart contract to [put out a hit](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/01/whats-at-the-intersection-of-crypto-and-ai-perhaps-murder/) on the protagonist. Yikes.
