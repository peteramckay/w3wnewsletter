The MIT Technology Review reports that book banners are ramping up their attacks on social media against educators. <!-- https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/07/15/1055959/book-bans-social-media-harassment/  -->


The week's other notable headlines:

- **Celsius declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy,** marking the latest [high-profile casualty](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/13/embattled-crypto-lender-celsius-informs-state-regulators-that-its-filing-for-bankruptcy-imminently-source-says-.html) of the crypto market's downturn since November. The embattled lender has a $1.2 billion shortfall on its balance sheet, according to its bankruptcy court [filing](https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/115/312902/126122257414.pdf) in New York.

- **Venture firms invested $2.2 billion** in crypto startups in June, the lowest total since August 2021, according to [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/157977/june-crypto-funding-roundup-vc-deals).

- **Circle issued** its first [monthly report](https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/USDC%20Reserves%20Reports/USDC%20Reserve%20Breakdown_June.pdf) disclosing the reserves backing its USDC stablecoin. The company says it currently holds $55.7 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury securities as collateral to back USDC, slightly above the total value of tokens in circulation.

- **Fed watching.** The Federal Reserve's Cleveland branch published a [new study](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/working-papers/2022-working-papers/wp-2219-the-lightning-network-turning-bitcoin-into-money.aspx) of the Lightning Network, with mostly favorable findings about its effect on improving the efficiency of bitcoin mining and transactions. Separately, the Fed hired Michael Barr, [a former Ripple adviser](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/13/former-crypto-adviser-michael-barr-confirmed-as-top-us-financial-watchdog/), as its new vice chair for supervision, an important regulatory role within the U.S. central bank.

- **Binance founder Changpeng Zhao** posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1546624143432433664?s=20&t=GvzxbBMpQ84NstWqiG6U8A) warning of a potential security flaw in Uniswap's code. But it [turned out](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phishing-villain-targets-uniswap-users-161743156.html) to be a phishing scam instead.

- **Business Insider reported that Coinbase** is planning to [suspend](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/experts-trouble-coinbase-shuts-affiliate/) its U.S. affiliate marketing program as a cost-cutting measure. However, the exchange may resume the program next year to offer third-party websites incentives for sending traffic to Coinbase.

- **Disney chose Polygon** among a cohort of six companies in the latest class of its [innovation accelator program](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/2022-disney-accelerator-participants-announced/). The Polygon network's native token (MATIC) rallied 16% for the week on hopes the entertainment giant will integrate Polygon into its digital products.

- **A new governance token for StarkNet** is [in the works](https://www.theblock.co/post/157323/starkware-confirms-launch-of-starknet-token-with-no-airdrops-until-next-year).

- **This conversation really only comes up in bear markets.** There's a pecking order to getting liquidated in crypto world, with some methods conveying [more social status](https://twitter.com/juthica/status/1546814655825416193) to an investor than others, says Kraken executive Juthica Chou. I'm pretty sure she's at least half-joking.
