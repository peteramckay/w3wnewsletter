**A surprisingly timely quote** from legendary business journalist Charles Dow, uttered in 1900:

*"There is always a disposition in people's minds to think that existing conditions will be permanent. When the market is down and dull, it is hard to make people believe that this is the prelude to a period of activity and advance. When the prices are up and the country is prosperous, it is always said that while preceding booms have not lasted, there are circumstances connected with this one which will make it unlike its predecessors and give assurance of permanency. The one fact pertaining to all conditions is that they will change."*

By "the market," Dow no doubt meant the *stock* market. But the psychology he described could just have easily applied to crypto or bonds or gold or real estate or many other things.

- **Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom** says reams of data make it clear: Knowledge workers will never return en masse to the office for a old Monday-to-Friday schedule by default. Hybrid work has definitively won. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/opinion/office-work-home-remote.html))

- **ICYMI:** Breakdancing will be an Olympic sport at the 2024 Games. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/arts/dance/olympics-breaking-dance.html))
