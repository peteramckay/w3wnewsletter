# Congress isn't going to fix web2.
## The new TikTok bill shows why. Better for devs and users to take it upon ourselves to build new networks.

Lede item. Should run ~450 words.

**Someone please remind me again.** Why does regulating web2 make more sense than replacing it?

CNOOC port deal example.

- It violates the First Amendment rights of the users.

- The question of who owns a social network is hardly the most important thing that matters. All they have to do is use it to spread disinformation.

- Galloway: "mendacious f*&^ks"

- Farcaster panel as a positive alternative: "You're identity travels with you." Take verbatim from moderator around 19-minute mark at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNvQpDGu5g

- Shout out Dixon book.

### Week in Review: March 10-16, 2024

- **The Ethereum network's Dencun upgrade** went live Wednesday. The new software is designed to significantly lower transaction costs for layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum -- a longstanding headache for developers. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dencun-upgrade-live-ethereum-mainnet)) <!-- Need links -->

- **Token prices took a volatile ride.** Bitcoin hit several new records throughout the week, peaking near $74,000 per token Thursday. But then a [wave of profit-taking](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-retreats-record-high-bubble-031039357.html) took over, erasing all the gains and then some. As of late Friday's trading in New York, bitcoin posted a weekly decline of 0.5%. Ethereum was down 7%. But altcoins showed some strength, which helped keep the broader crypto market's valuation steady at $2.6 trillion, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#market-cap) data.

- **Individual investors in the U.S.** have been active buyers of exchange-traded bitcoin funds since January. But financial advisors -- a key audience that manages $30 trillion in client assets -- have been more reticent. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/hot-new-bitcoin-funds-are-still-waiting-for-buy-in-from-financial-advisers-4a470ada?st=a7ildg5woxl54dw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **A tweet from El Salvador's president** signaled that the country's sovereign bitcoin holdings are now worth over $400 million, much bigger than previously believed. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/221866/el-salvador-bitcoin-treasury-wallet))

- **Britain's High Court ruled** that Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who controversially claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, is indeed not the founder of bitcoin. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/craig-wright-not-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-creator-ruling/?mbid=social_twitter))

- **CoinShares announced** plans to [buy Valkyrie's exchange-traded fund business](https://coinshares.com/news/coinshares-strengthens-its-global-reach-by-completing-acquisition-of-valkyrie-etf-business) for an undisclosed sum.

- **Fox's chief technology officer** told TechCrunch's Chain Reaction podcast that an experiment using the Polygon chain to verify that videos aren't deepfakes created by AI has gone well so far. Based on this work, the media giant just released Verify, an open protocol for media companies and consumers.

### Odds & Ends

- **Three new studies paint a dire outlook** for Earth's ice caps due to rising temperatures at both poles. One predicts ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean by 2050, regardless of whether nations meet emissions targets set in the Paris climate accords. Another study shows a dramatic increase in Antarctic polynyas, or pockets of open water among the sea ice. And a third concludes that Arctic sea life has not benefited as expected from the loss of sea ice so far. Ugh.
