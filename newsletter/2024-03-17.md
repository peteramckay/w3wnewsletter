# Congress isn't going to fix web2.
## The new TikTok bill shows why. Better for devs and users to take it upon ourselves to build new networks.

Lede item. Should run ~450 words.

**Someone please remind me again.** Why does regulating web2 make more sense than replacing it?

CNOOC port deal example.

- It violates the First Amendment rights of the users.

- The question of who owns a social network is hardly the most important thing that matters. All they have to do is use it to spread disinformation.

- Galloway: "mendacious f*&^ks"

- Farcaster panel as a positive alternative: "You're identity travels with you." Take verbatim from moderator around 19-minute mark at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNvQpDGu5g

- Shout out Dixon book.

### Week in Review: March 10-16, 2024

- Ethereum upgrade. <!-- Need links -->

- **Token prices took a volatile ride.** Bitcoin hit a new record above TKTKTK on TKTKTK, but then a wave of profit-taking took over, sending the market to a loss for the week as a whole. As of late Friday trading in New York, bitcoin posted a weekly decline of TKTKTK%. Ethereum was down TKTKTK. Global crypto market cap fell TKTK% to TKTKTK trillion.

### Odds & Ends

- **Three recent studies paint a dire outlook** for Earth's ice caps due to rising temperatures at both poles. One predicts ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean by 2050, regardless of whether nations meet emissions-reduction targets set in the Paris climate accords. Another study shows a dramatic increase in Antarctic polynyas, or pockets of open water that can exist within sea ice. A third study reveals that Arctic sea life has not benefited as expected from the loss of sea ice so far. Ugh.
