# Congress isn't going to fix web2.
## The new TikTok bill shows why. Better for devs and users to take it upon ourselves to build new networks.

**Americans should have learned by now** that we can't defend our country by shredding its Constitution. If our adversaries are adversaries in the first place because ["they hate our freedoms,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PKRHgmHzK0) in the famous words our president post-9/11, then it must also be true that we do the bad guys' work for them when we steamroll those freedoms ourselves.

Still, we continue to try. Witness the new bill in Congress to [force a sale](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/15/tiktok-ban-senate-slows-vote-bytedance/) of Chinese-owned ByteDance, operator of TikTok. If a sale doesn't take place within six months -- probably [an unrealistic timeframe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/03/17/tiktok-sale-ban-challenges/) compared to past tech mergers -- then the bill would ban TikTok in the U.S. altogether.

That last condition is problematic as it conflicts with the [First Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-i) rights of [170 million Americans](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tiktok-ban-bill-congress-senate-means-date-rcna143189) currently using TikTok. But the ostensible reason why many members of Congress are OK with a possible ban is that it would prevent surveillance of American citizens by the Chinese Communist Party via ByteDance.

Because, you know, the CCP are authoritarians who hate things like our First Amendment. Thus we might have to ban tens of millions of people from the online forum of their choice.

Makes perfect sense, no?

Look, I'm skeptical of CCP influence on ByteDance myself. It's a major reason I'm not on TikTok. But many other Americans feel differently, and they have a right to participate on that platform under the First Amendment.

It's also demonstrably true that we've had egregious privacy and safety abuses and, yes, attacks on our national security by foreign adversaries via *U.S.-based* platforms [like Facebook](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/26/facebook-disinformation-russia-report/). And Congress has done almost nothing about it except occasional [grandstanding in hearings](https://www.cnn.com/tech/live-news/meta-x-discord-tiktok-snap-chiefs-testimony-senate/index.html) with tech executives.

But in terms of writing laws to actually fix the situation? Zilch, except for this TikTok proposal that singles out one company and leaves all the other problematic ones untouched.

Better that Congress should write clear regulations around user rights and data transparency for all the platforms, then enforce them fairly *for everyone*. Then, if TikTok or any other platform is enabling surveillance or other abuses, they should be penalized uniformly according to the rules.

Barring a sudden outbreak of such common sense in Congress, though, I think we need to maintain focus on building [decentralized alternatives](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/desoc-a-deep-dive-into-decentralized-social-networks) to web2 platforms like TikTok and Facebook. Unlike federal legislation, [web3](https://peteramckay.medium.com/a-brief-release-history-of-the-web-aeef5bb3b814) is a separate solution -- one entirely within the power of developers and users to implement and adopt -- that cuts to the core problem of reclaiming control of our data.

To put it a different way: Why should we continue to believe it makes more sense to regulate web2 than to replace it? The question becomes even more urgent when the would-be regulators reveal themselves, through measures like the TikTok bill, to be so profoundly clueless.

### Week in Review: March 10-16, 2024

- **The Ethereum network's Dencun upgrade** went live Wednesday. The new software is designed to significantly lower transaction costs for layer-2 networks built atop Ethereum -- a longstanding headache for developers. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dencun-upgrade-live-ethereum-mainnet))

- **Token prices took a volatile ride.** Bitcoin hit several new records throughout the week, peaking near $74,000 per token Thursday. But then a [wave of profit-taking](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-retreats-record-high-bubble-031039357.html) took over, erasing all the gains and then some. As of Sunday morning in New York, bitcoin has posted a 7-day decline of 3%. Ethereum is down 8%. But altcoins are showing some strength, which has helped keep the broader crypto market's valuation steady at $2.6 trillion, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#market-cap) data.

- **Individual investors in the U.S.** have been active buyers of exchange-traded bitcoin funds since January. But financial advisors -- a key audience that manages $30 trillion in client assets -- have been more reticent. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/hot-new-bitcoin-funds-are-still-waiting-for-buy-in-from-financial-advisers-4a470ada?st=a7ildg5woxl54dw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **A tweet from El Salvador's president** signaled that the country's sovereign bitcoin holdings are now worth over $400 million, much bigger than previously believed. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/221866/el-salvador-bitcoin-treasury-wallet))

- **Britain's High Court ruled** that Australian computer scientist Craig Wright, who controversially claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, is indeed not the founder of bitcoin. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/craig-wright-not-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-creator-ruling/?mbid=social_twitter))

- **CoinShares announced** plans to [buy Valkyrie's exchange-traded fund business](https://coinshares.com/news/coinshares-strengthens-its-global-reach-by-completing-acquisition-of-valkyrie-etf-business) for an undisclosed sum.

- **Fox's chief technology officer** told TechCrunch's Chain Reaction podcast that an experiment using the Polygon chain to verify that videos aren't deepfakes created by AI has gone well so far. Based on this work, the media giant just released Verify, an open protocol for media companies and consumers. ([TechCrunch](https://chain-reaction.simplecast.com/episodes/blockchain-tech-is-working-to-combat-ai-based-deepfakes-w-melody-hildebrandt-and-mike-blank))

### Odds & Ends

- **Three new studies paint a dire outlook** for Earth's ice caps due to rising temperatures at both poles. One predicts ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean by 2050, regardless of whether nations meet emissions targets set in the Paris climate accords. Another study shows a dramatic increase in Antarctic polynyas, or pockets of open water among the sea ice. And a third concludes that Arctic sea life has not benefited as expected from the loss of sea ice so far. Ugh.
