## Heading Home
### April 3-9, 2022

**I'm wrapping up** my [trip to Amsterdam](https://blogchain.app/p/talking-decentralization-in-the-netherlands/8fEkzseLYt) for the latest [all-hands meeting](https://twitter.com/peteramckay/status/1511590910181658625) of the Capsule Social [team](https://twitter.com/CapsuleSoc/status/1512051647287107589). We got a lot of [important work](https://twitter.com/CapsuleSoc/status/1512059339166560265) done, queued up some [important things to come](https://twitter.com/kaepora/status/1511655645220646919) for the Blogchain platform over the next few months, and even got to enjoy this lovely city a little.
A personal favorite: The [Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en), especially their Rembrandt collection. If you're ever in Amsterdam, please don't miss it.
Now, on to some decentralization headlines:
