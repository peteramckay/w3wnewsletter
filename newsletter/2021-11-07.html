        <br>

        <p><strong>I'll stick a little closer to home than usual with this admittedly America-centric update.</strong> No disrespect to the rest of the world, which of course has seen a general move toward decentralized tech the last few years. It just seems we had a particularly busy flow of headlines here last week that bears noting:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Congress passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill,</strong> which includes new crypto <a href="https://decrypt.co/85450/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-paving-way-for-extra-crypto-taxes-in-u-s">taxes and reporting requirements</a>. The measure is expected to be signed into law by President Biden this week.</li>


          <li><strong>Crypto hiring in the U.S. has been spread widely among different cities.</strong> Although major centers like San Francisco and New York certainly have a solid share of workers in the industry, about 53% of crypto hires so far in 2021 have been in smaller chunks around the rest of the country, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-study-reveals-which-us-cities-lead-crypto-hires-in-2021">reports</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>The mayors of two major U.S. cities will get paid a portion of their salaries in bitcoin.</strong> On Tuesday, Miami's Francis Suarez said he would take his next paycheck <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/miami-mayor-suarez-to-take-next-paycheck-in-bitcoin/">entirely in bitcoin</a>. Then New York's newly elected chief Eric Adams one-upped him on Thursday, saying he would accept his <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/04/mayor-elect-eric-adams-vows-to-make-nyc-crypto-friendly/">next three paychecks</a> in bitcoin. Both have said they would like to turn their cities into blockchain hubs.</li>

          <li><strong>Non-fungible tokens are taking over New York.</strong> So says my old Dow Jones colleague Mike Casey, now chief content officer at CoinDesk, in a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/nfts-take-over-nyc/">new post</a> describing his main takeaways from the recent NFT.NYC conference. The event sold 5,500 tickets, with 3,000 people left on the waitlist, Casey reports.</li>

          <li><strong>Solana, Lightspeed, and FTX</strong> are launching a new $100 million fund to invest in companies <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-ventures-lightspeed-venture-partners-and-ftx-launch-100m-gaming-fund">"at the intersection of blockchain and gaming."</a></li>


          <li><strong>Meanwhile, Jack In the Box is suing FTX</strong> over its new "moon man" mascot. The burger chain <a href="https://decrypt.co/85436/jack-in-the-box-sues-ftx-over-moon-man-mascot">alleges infringement</a> on its intellectual property because the "moon man" is too similar to its own ball-headed clown mascot, who is of course named Jack.</li>


          <li><strong>The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school</strong> said it will <a href="https://decrypt.co/84616/wharton-business-school-accept-tuition-payment-bitcoin-ethereum">accept tuition payments</a> in bitcoin and ether for an executive education course in tokenomics. The crypto payment option is a first in U.S. higher education.</li>

          <li><strong>More Facebook drama.</strong> The social giant said it will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html">shut down</a> a decade-old facial recognition project due to mounting privacy concerns. Separately, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bad-for-you-360-million-users-say-yes-company-documents-facebook-files-11636124681?mod=hp_lead_pos8">reported</a> on a leaked in-house study at Facebook that showed its platform is a compulsion that hurts other areas of life for one in eight users, or about 360 million people.</li>


          <li><strong>Throwback!</strong> On Friday, Prince's official Twitter feed <a href="https://twitter.com/prince/status/1456648223880273923">re-shared</a> a 2004 interview of the late singer by <a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/09/the-prince-pipeline/">Wired</a>. The focus is Prince's early adoption of new technologies, and why he viewed that approach as a way to maintain creative independence. Always relevant stuff. üëç</li>
