**One uncanny tic you encounter as a journalist** covering Wall Street is that finance people sometimes say hugely consequential things in the most deadpan clinical tone. You have to listen very closely to register the substantive impact or, in some cases, the part that *wasn't* said at all that speaks volumes.

This can of course be purposeful misdirection, but that's less common than one might expect. Even for the literal honest brokers, it is more a matter of the inherent abstraction of what they do and the routine (for them) of moving around such vast sums of money at the push of a button.

Such transactions ultimately affect actual human lives, sometimes profoundly so. But that last part usually remains unspoken, perhaps because it is so obvious among practitioners that they don't need to remind each other. As an observer, though, it's a good idea to constantly remind yourself.

In the most delicious way, bitcoiner Peter McCormack's [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-6BSNXedc) with Joseph Wang, a former trader on the Federal Reserve's bond desk, is a mother lode of these sort of moments.

Some highlights:

- (22:00ish) Recent inflation comes from printing money during the pandemic. "I think it's pretty easy, really. We gave everybody a bunch of free money. What did you think would happen?"

- (28:30) McCormack asks about 50 percent inflation or greater. Fed is not well run

- 33:00 Bearish on global econ next 10 years. And why. Goes on to say he agrees with Lyn Alden prediction for a decade of roller-coaster inflation.

- (53:30) CBDC in the US is a "terrifying prospect." Powell isn't keen on CBDC, is waiting for Congress to act.

- (47:25) But we do need it in some form. Solved a real problem.

Other timestamps...

(10:20) Discussion of what it means for the Fed to raise or lower official interest rates and how that works.
