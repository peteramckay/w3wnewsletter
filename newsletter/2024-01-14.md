**At long last,** U.S. investors can bet on bitcoin [via their traditional investment accounts](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/01/10/bitcoin-etfs-win-sec-approval-bringing-easier-access-to-biggest-cryptocurrency/) with stockbrokers. <!-- Need a link -->

Yay?

Frankly, Thursday's [long-awaited](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-etf-approval-marks-conclusion-of-a-decade-long-journey/ar-AA1mNsj0) launch of trading in [11 exchange-traded funds](https://investorplace.com/2024/01/11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-received-sec-approval-heres-the-complete-list/) that hold bitcoin on investors' behalf didn't go exactly as expected.

To help understand the good, the bad, and the inbetween of the situation, I think it's helpful to use a metaphor proposed recently by Raoul Pal, a former Goldman Sachs executive, early bitcoin investor, and founder of the [Real Vision](https://www.realvision.com/) media platform.

He likens people who directly invested in bitcoin previously to the seed investors in a tech startup. Or Series A investors, or Series B, or whatever, [depending on when they got in](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/102015/series-b-c-funding-what-it-all-means-and-how-it-works.asp). (Full disclosure: I own bitcoin and would certainly include myself in this category.) Now the ETF launch is akin to a startup's initial public offering, when smaller public investors get involved via Wall Street's trading venues.

If we take the IPO metaphor a little further, though, we get to one disappointing aspect of the new bitcoin funds: Heading into Monday's trading session on Wall Street, bitcoin's token price is down about 5% compared to midday Wednesday, shortly before the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its approval of the new ETFs.

In other words, owners of so-called [spot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spotmarket.asp) bitcoin -- the actual token -- haven't really benefited from the ETF launch yet. In a traditional IPO, which is supposed to produce a profit for early-stage investors, that might be considered a "busted" offering.

That said, there are still reasons for hope over the longer term. For starters, bitcoin's 155% rally in 2023 was driven largely by anticipation of the ETFs. So we might dismiss the last couple days' selling as a bit of harmless profit taking.

The new funds also saw solid trading volume, including $4.6 billion in turnover the first day. So at least investors aren't ignoring them altogether. Bitcoin bulls are hoping that attention could could turn into buying later. Analyst forecast there could be up to $100 billion of new money allocated to bitcoin this year via ETFs, according to [Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/us-bitcoin-etfs-see-46b-in-volume-in-first-day-of-trading/ar-AA1mQJNn).

Also notable: Because of the public nature of prices on the Bitcoin network, the launch of bitcoin ETFs was arguably orders of magnitude more transparent *before, during, and after* the offerings than a conventional IPO would have been. By comparison, early venture funding of startups, valuations of such companies, and pre-IPO underwriting are some of the most opaque processes that exist in any corner of the financial world.

Over time, I think it will also be fascinating to see how the twin cultures of early bitcoin adopters and Wall Streeters continue to interact, clash, and evolve. Bitcoin's famously pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto explicitly designed his creation as an antidote to centralized finance. By that standard, does it really make sense to rejoice at a listing on the NYSE or Nasdaq pegged to bitcoin?

Pal, who knows both cultures as well as anyone, addressed this tension in [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtnZM2QVjU&t=1080s) with the Crypto Banter podcast. Referring to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a frequent crypto foe who [reluctantly](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023) voted in favor of ETF approval, Pal said:  

"You can either take it as, 'Well, Gary's won and we kind of put it (bitcoin) inside Wall Street's walls.' Or: We put the Trojan horse *inside of Wall Street.* I'll go with the latter."

# Week in Review

The week's notable developments in other corners of the tokenized economy:

- **Stablecoin issuer Circle** says it has filed a proposal with the SEC to do an IPO in the U.S. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/stablecoin-firm-circle-confidentially-files-us-ipo-2024-01-11/))

- **The Solana Foundation** released a [report](https://solana.com/news/2023-state-of-solana-developer-ecosystem) regarding its efforts to grow their developer community in 2023. The foundation said participation and retention improved markedly throughout the year, with 2,500-3,000 monthly active developers contributing to Solana's open-source code.

- **PayPal's stablecoin PYUSD** saw its market cap grow 70% over the last month to $290 million, helped by new listings on crypto exchanges. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/272309/paypals-stablecoin-market-cap-grows-70-over-last-month-to-290-million))

- **Forbes reports** that Genesis Global Trading reached an [$8 million settlement](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/01/12/genesis-settlement-department-financial-services-barry-silbert-bitlicense-crypto/) with New York state regulators for failing to failing to maintain adequate anti-money laundering and cybersecurity safeguards. Genesis, a unit of Digital Currency Group, will also cease operations in the state and forfeit its BitLicense, a sometimes-controversial certification that New York has created for digital asset brokerages. In a [recent report](https://www.osc.ny.gov/files/state-agencies/audits/pdf/sga-2024-22s18.pdf), the state's comptroller criticized the thoroughness and security of BitLicense enforcement.

- **The NEAR Foundation** said will cut employee headcount [by 40%](https://pages.near.org/blog/an-update-from-the-near-foundation/) in an effort to focus spending on a "higher-impact set of activities" to support the NEAR developer community.

- **Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon** has asked a U.S. court to push back his civil fraud trial from Jan. 29 to mid-March so that he can appear in person. Kwon is currently in Montenegro awaiting extradition. ([Bloomberg](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/terra-kwon-says-us-extradition-180159581.html))

- **Sotheby's opened bidding** in an auction of 19 artworks created as Bitcoin Ordinals, a type of non-fungible token. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/272357/sothebys-bitcoin-ordinals-auction))

- **Maybe don't DYOR?** A [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06883-y) published in the journal Nature suggests that asking news consumers to conduct their own research to evaluate misinformation often has the unintended effect of making such stories seem *more* believable, not less.
