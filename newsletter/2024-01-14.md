At least 11 years in the making...

Spot bitcoin ETF. oil prices. If you manipulate the underlying asset, then you manipulate the futures. It's inescapable.

Oil is openly manipulated by the OPEC cartel.

Historically, silver ... But there's an ETF on it.

Double leverage ETFs. extra leverage, above. A workaround to the SEC's own

Approaching one-third of the U.S. stock market's $50 trillion total valuation.





In the U.S. there are no insider trading rules around bitcoin.

But neither are there rules on commodities like gold, oil, and so on.

Lead item should riff on big BTC listing. Some possible angle:

- NEWMKT: Now is a good time to re-think the stock market itself. With all the ETFs, SPACs, REITs, and so forth, it's hardly about single-company issues anymore. They're now about a third of the U.S. stock market's $50 trillion valuation.

- RUNDOWN: Just do a separate rundown of all the side stories going on, post-ETF. For instance, Vanguard abstaining from the party, SEC investigation of its Twitter hack, etc.

- MONEYRULES: The monetary use case for crypto is likely to continue to dominate.

- 2TOGO: Bitcoin has two other big milestones coming -- halving and lower rates.

- BITCOIN: SEC has inadvertently wound up empowering bitcoin.

- USMESS: Don't be fooled by the ETF approval. The US regulatory picture for crypto is still a mess.

- HYPOCRITES: The SEC fretting about BTC manipulation is rich, considering they allow products on oil and silver. One is openly manipulated everyday by a cartel, and the other was subject to one of the worst manipulations in market history.

- ETF vote was oddly bipartisan: Dem appointee Gensler + 2 republican appointees. Two other dem appointees voted no.

The data I provided on the total valuation figures for the U.S. equities market is likely from 2023, as that is the current year. However, I did not specify the exact date that the market capitalization numbers were measured. Financial market valuations can fluctuate over time. Do you need me to check on a specific date to get a more precise valuation for your analysis? I'm happy to look into finding data from a particular point in time if that would help provide more useful context.

Oh, great. Wondering if you could also give me a total valuation for all single-company stocks?

Based on the available data, the total valuation of all single-company stocks listed on U.S. exchanges is approximately $30 trillion. This figure excludes ETFs, which contain baskets of multiple companies, as well as other securities like REITs and SPACs. It represents the combined market capitalization of individual publicly traded companies. Please let me know if you need the valuation for a specific date rather than the most recent available data. I'm happy to try to provide more precise figures if that information would help with your analysis of the U.S. stock market.

Gensler: Wants to be Treasury secretary, according to Wood.

Warren: Gets clicks talking about crypto, according to Perianne Boring.
- Bitcoin is not a security.

- Other ETFs abound holding. Crude oil and gold are not securities, for instance. They're commodities. But there are now ETFs available that hold these assets. Real-estate investment trusts.

- Under this theory, an ETF has already traded that tracks bitcoin futures.

- Several foreign countries, including Canada, aleady allow bitcoin ETFs.
