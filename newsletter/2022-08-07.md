# Checking in on crypto's Big Two
## #Web3 Weekly: July 31 to Aug. 6, 2022

**There are thousands of crypto networks out there,** but it's always worth remembering that just two really dominate the marketplace.

Bitcoin and Ethereum combined represent about 60% of the $1.1 trillion valuation of the global token market, according to CoinMarketCap.

Hence I think it's worth highlighting here a couple of important stories CoinDesk just ran about the future of each of these giants: 

- **Frederick Munawa** has been reporting on the rise of [application development on the Lightning Network](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/07/move-over-ethereum-bitcoins-lightning-network-has-apps-too/), a major platform for enabling faster bitcoin transactions.  
- **Margaux Nijkerk** covered [possible changes](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/05/what-the-merge-means-for-ethereum-miners/) that might be on the way for Ethereum mining -- a $16 billion industry -- once the network fully adopts a new proof-of-stake protocol this fall.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **MicroStrategy,** a consultancy that famously became one of the first public companies to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, announced that Michael Saylor will [step down as chief executive](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/microstrategy-ceo-saylor-moves-to-chairman-role-focusing-on-strategy-and-bitcoin/ar-AA10eKnh) but remain executive chairman. Current president Phong Le will take over as CEO.

- **The venture firm Hashed** lost $3 billion in the recent crash of the Luna token, Bloomberg News [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-02/early-investor-in-defunct-luna-token-plans-to-raise-another-fund?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google).

- **Solana users** lost more than $5 million tokens [due to a hack](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-wallet-hack-know-far-144428367.html) of wallets built for that network.

- **The New York Times reported** on bitcoin maximalists' renewed efforts to [distance themselves](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/technology/crypto-bitcoin-maximalists.html) from the altcoin industry during the latest crypto bear market.

- **Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp**, an early bitcoin advocate, says that [reducing complexity](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/02/what-is-cryptos-downfall-its-complexity/) needs to be a major priority in the crypto industry to improve security and attract new users.

- **AMTD Digital,** a financial tech company based in Hong Kong, has become a meme stock on steroids. Shares rallied 32,000% in just a few weeks, then fell steeply on Friday, [wiping out $175 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amtd-wild-rise-comes-crashing-124216915.html) in market value. The reasons for the moves remain murky for now.

- **Time flies.** Astronomers say Earth recently completed its [shortest day](https://www.space.com/earth-rotation-record-shortest-day). Due to a slight variation in the planet's rotation, June 29 was 1.59 milliseconds shorter than the full 24 hours in a normal day.
