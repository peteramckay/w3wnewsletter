# #Web3Weekly: Nov. 26 to Dec. 2, 2023

<!--  Very, very brief intro. Just a few sentences... -->

### Week in Review

- **Investors have moved $1.4 billion in bitcoin off exchanges since Nov. 14,** according to data from Glassnode. Such activity generally reflects bullish sentiment among investors, who bid bitcoin to a weekly gain of 6%. The token recently traded at an 18-month high near $40,000 per coin, bolstered by hopes for rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and imminent U.S. regulatory approval of an exchange-traded fund holding bitcoin.

- **Binance founder and former chief executive "CZ" Zhao** [stepped down](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/28/changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down-from-binanceus-board/) as chairman of the exchange's U.S. affiliate. While Binance.US was not part of parent Binance's recent [$4.3 billion settlement](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/21/binance-to-settle-charges-with-us-doj-source/) with American regulators, it is still facing its own case with the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegely offering unregistered securities to U.S. investors.

- **OpenAI competitor Anthropic** has an unconventional governance structure of its own that could lead to similar management turmoil at some point. ([Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2023/12/anthropic-openai-board-trust-effective-altruism.html))
