# #Web3Weekly

## Feb. 6-12, 2022

**Crypto cropped up in some unlikely places last week,** playing a background role in several major geopolitical stories.

Canadian Truckers protesting COVID19 vaccine mandates have been [raising money in bitcoin](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22925823/canadian-trucker-convoy-anti-vaxx-bitcoin-press-conference) since GoFundMe shut down their fundraising on that platform. Similarly, according to the analytics company Elliptic, several pro-independence groups are soliciting bitcoin donations to [support Ukraine's struggle](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/ukrainians-turn-to-bitcoin-to-crowdfund-the-fight-against-russia) against neighboring Russia. And Reuters [reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-nkorea-grows-nuclear-missiles-programs-profits-cyberattacks-un-report-2022-02-05/) that North Korea's regime has been generating some of its revenue, effectively ducking international economic sanctions, by attacking crypto exchanges.

Chalk it up as another subtle sign of crypto's mainstreaming, I guess. Whatever people do -- good, evil, or inbetween -- crypto is becoming a normal component of it along the way, not much different than paper money changing hands.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **U.S. authorities arrested** a husband and wife who allegedly were trying to launder bitcoin stolen during the 2016 hack of Bitfinex. Agents recovered [$3.6 billion in bitcoin](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-arrest-two-and-seize-3-6-billion-in-bitcoin-stolen-in-2016-hack-of-bitfinex-exchange-11644339957?mod=search_headlin), the largest asset seizure in U.S. history.
