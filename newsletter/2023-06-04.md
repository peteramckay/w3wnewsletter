**Decrypt spotted** a fascinating [contradiction](https://decrypt.co/142698/americans-may-not-love-crypto-but-these-top-brands-are-into-it) in the latest Axios Harris Poll 100, an annual ranking widely followed among marketers.

Axios Harris takes a novel two-step approach. First, pollsters determine the 100  brand names most widely recognized among the American public. Then they measure whether that recognition is due to negative or positive perceptions.

Among the most negatively perceived brands on [the 2023 list](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/23/corporate-brands-reputation-america) were Bitcoin, ranked 93, and FTX at 99. (Dead last was the Trump Organization, in case you're wondering.)

At the same time, Decrypt points out that several positively perceived brands are proudly experimenting with web3 via non-fungible tokens, in-house innovation labs, venture investment in the space, or other projects. The names in this category include Chick-Fil-A (#5 in the Axios Harris ranking), Toyota (#6), Sony (#12), Kellogg (#26), and Pfizer (#50).

**Why this matters:** The big question is how to interpret the mixed Axios Harris results as a [leading indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadingindicator.asp) of where web3 is headed. On the one hand, we have negative claims people are making *verbally* to pollsters. On the other, we have *actions* that other people are taking that reflect a diametrically opposite, more bullish outlook for the future.

I think it's obvious which one we should take more seriously. But, hey, judge for yourself.

The latest headlines:

- **Bitcoin and ether** both fell in May, suffering their first monthly declines of 2023. However, the two biggest tokens can still claim solid gains for the year overall, with bitcoin up 63% and ether up 55%, [according to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/bitcoin-falls-ahead-of-debt-ceiling-vote-heads-for-first-its-losing-month-of-the-year.html).

- **Hong Kong unveiled** new rules to allow licensed crypto exchanges to serve retail customers. Barron's [notes](https://www.barrons.com/news/hong-kong-launches-retail-friendly-rules-for-crypto-exchanges-eb6ab6c6) that the move is a notable exception to the recent trend of jurisdictions around the world tightening oversight of token markets.

- **Artificial intelligence could pose an extinction-level threat** to humanity, according to an [open letter](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk) by the nonprofit Center for AI Safety. More than 300 tech-industry insiders signed the document, which advocates [safeguards for AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html) similar to those concerning pandemics and nuclear weapons.

- **Chipmaker Nvidia's stock valuation** briefly [topped $1 trillion](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-sets-eye-1-trillion-market-value-2023-05-30/) on Wednesday, helped by expectations of strong sales for chips tailored to artificial intelligence applications. Nvidia retreated slightly to end the week with a valuation of $971 billion, just shy of the thirteen-digit milestone previously achieved by only a handful of stock-market behemoths like Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet.

- **Other AI updates:** Busines Insider [reports](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-trending-google-search-bitcoin-metaverse-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-2023-5) that Google searches for the term "AI" have increased markedly, but haven't yet equaled the peak of "bitcoin" searches set in 2017... New polling from the Pew Research Center shows that 60% of Americans have heard of ChatGPT, but [less than 15%](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/) have actually tried it...
