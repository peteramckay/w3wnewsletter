# A capitalist critique of Big Tech oligarchy
## #Web3Weekly: Aug 20-26, 2023

**We shoul all consider it deeply problematic** for just a handful of trillion-dollar companies, all based in a single country, to control everyone's daily experience of the internet.

For this reason, the final pick in my summer series highlighting videos about the basics of web3 is this [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ebKI4x_k8A) by professor, author, and entrepreneur Scott Galloway from 2017. In it, "Prof G" argues cogently for breaking up America's Big Tech oligarchy, with a focus on Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple.

At the time, Galloway had recently published an excellent book about those particular behemoths, aptly titled [The Four](https://www.amazon.com/The-Four-Scott-Galloway-audiobook/dp/B07565MYD1/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+four+galloway&sr=8-1). And he's since explored their dangers in other social content he's created, [podcasts](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/the-prof-g-pod-with-scott-galloway), and subsequent books.

The 2017 talk is emblematic of that long-term expertise he's developed, and it holds up extremely well, in my opinion. In many ways, we're *still* grappling with the issues he raises about Big Tech hegemony, especially the anti-competitive practices that effectively choke off innovation by smaller entrants.

Also very important: Galloway speaks from the perspective of a through-and-through capitalist. Prior to joining the faculty of New York University, he started and sold several startups himself, served on the boards of others, and has been an early investor in companies as well.

In other words, this guy is no Bernie Sanders-style anti-corporate crusader. If *he's* concerned, of all people, maybe the rest of us should be as well regarding Big Tech.

I should also point out: Galloway has been a [sometime critic](https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/) of web3 as an industry as well. But that's OK. Even if I disagree with some of what he's said in that regard, I still believe he's done us all a great service by pointing out the foibles **of web2** in such searing detail.

That's an important part of understanding why decentralization matters, in my opinion. After all, we have to think through and communicate to the public why the thing we're trying to replace sucks. You may be used to it, perhaps to the point of taking it for granted. But it still sucks.

[ICYMI](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=icymi) here are my earlier picks in the "web3 basics" series:

- Wired magazine's explainer [Wired magazine's explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0&t=49s) of "what is blockchain," tailored so even a five-year old can understand it.

- [Author Ben Mezrich telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN96Dgih3gI) the "making of" backstory behind his book [Bitcoin Billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Billionaires-Genius-Betrayal-Redemption/dp/1250217741/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1), a classic history of the crypto market's early days.

- On Ethereum's recent eighth anniversary, Fortune paused to discuss the network's past, present, and future. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKmbxd4MQmk&t=618s). <!-- In less than 15 minutes, reporter Rosemarie Miller covers a *lot* of ground about the platform's history and its future through her chat with blockchain entrepreneur Jamiel Shiekh. -->

- Journalist Johnny Harris does a great job explaining what non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz9zw7-_vhM).

- [Meet Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9RWTMNnvi4), the "godfather of AI" who quit his job at Google so he could speak more frankly about the technology's risks.
