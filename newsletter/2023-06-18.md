**Microsoft is hitting some big milestones** due to its investment in OpenAI -- but it's also facing daunting new challenges.

The software giant's forecast that revenue from artificial intelligence will hit $10 billion a year drove Microsoft shares to a [new all-time high](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/microsoft-stock-hits-record-as-leaders-see-10-billion-in-ai-revenue.html) Thursday, nudging the company's overall valuation to [$2.6 trillion](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/microsoft-nears-all-time-closing-high-2-6-trillion-value-amid-ai-powered-rally). That puts Microsoft within reach of Apple ($2.9 trillion valuation) to perhaps become the world's most valuable tech company soon.

At the same time, the Wall Street Journal reported on some [disturbing internal conflicts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51?st=7ju6ktldi0590dj&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) between Microsoft and OpenAI.

For me, the worst revelation is that OpenAI advised Microsoft against integrating ChatGPT into the search engine Bing, as the popular chatbot [needed more training](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759348/openai-microsoft-bing-ai-warning-gpt-4) for such an application. But Microsoft didn't listen, ultimately leading to cringe-inducing user interactions and embarrassing publicity for both companies.  

Keep in mind, this isn't Microsoft's first such misadventure. Back in 2016, the company connected a chatbot named Tay to Twitter that [clearly wasn't ready](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/microsoft-tay-racist-tweets_n_56f3e678e4b04c4c37615502) for prime time. It started spewing hate speech after less than a day online and had to be shut down.

Crucially, these incidents should be taken as important context to the ongoing discussion of AI's potential risks to society. Such fretting is often couched in very broad, high-level technical terms, as if AI software might evolve mysteriously and entirely on its own into something dangerous.

But there is also a more mundane, very familiar risk that's at least as dangerous: dumbass governance decisions made by greedy human beings. It's the old gap between "could do" and "should do," as Jurassic Park famously [put it](https://youtu.be/4PLvdmifDSk?t=46) 30 years ago.

Perhaps that risk is especially worth minding at oligarchic Big Tech companies that already have a track record of abusing users and shirking responsibility to the broader society.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Tether briefly lost its peg** to the U.S. dollar on Thursday due to [heavy swap trading](https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-pool-imbalance-usdt-depeg-concerns-tether-cto-calls-it-fud) on the Curve platform, where traders unloaded USDT for rivals DAI and USDC. Tether has since regained its $1 price, but the incident is a worrisome precedent due to USDT's role as a tool to finance trades throughout the broader token market.

- **The Federal Reserve's policy committee** held its rate target [steady at 5%](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-june-2023-pause-how-much-rcna88922), surprising traders who expected another hike to fight inflation. Market response has been muted so far, but if the Fed remains dovish for the longer-term, that would tend to support investment in risk assets like stocks and crypto. <!-- Update as needed -->

- **See how that works, America?** Brazil's government just designated its central bank and its securities commission as the responsible agencies for regulating crypto. Now it's [perfectly clear](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/14/brazil-appoints-central-bank-and-securities-commission-as-crypto-market-regulators) to everyone who does and doesn't have authority over this new investment category there. Must be nice.
