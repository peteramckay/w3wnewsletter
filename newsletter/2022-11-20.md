**We staged a crypto conference** in Miami on Thursday less than a mile from FTX Arena, which will soon [be renamed](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-miami-heat-ftx-arena-renaming-20221111-kieso374wne7lilbw2b6k2pdqa-story.html) for [obvious reasons](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cryptocurrency/ftx-ceo-says-sam-bankman-fried-ran-group-without-trust-controls). Talk about juxtaposition.

I use the term "we" loosely here to refer to this newsletter's partner TechCrunch, which you've probably noticed has been sponsoring #Web3Weekly recently to promote its conference, dubbed [TC Sessions: Crypto](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-crypto-2022/). Likewise, the newsletter was a Silver level co-sponsor of the event -- and I'm glad to have done it.

The grim topic of FTX's meltdown and what it means for the broader crypto industry dominated the conference's panel discussions. But that's OK. No point in ignoring the elephant in the room. If anything, this was a perfect time for the community to meet the old-fashioned way, comisserate a little, and figure out how to move on.

I think it also helped greatly to have TechCrunch's journalists hosting most of the panel discussions. They asked appropriately tough questions, and the industry insiders took them in stride, answering as best they could.

Some highlights:

- **Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao** made his most extensive public comments to date rearding the collapse of rival FTX. Speaking to the conference's [opening session](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/binances-cz-on-ftx-we-were-the-last-straw-that-broke-the-camels-back/) via a remote video feed, the CEO who goes by his initials CZ said
he didn't know full details of the problems at FTX prior to its meltdown, though some "mental mathematics" him gave a general sense of its competitive position versus Binance.

- **Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong** was also [slated to speak](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-ceo-dives-into-market-madness-at-tc-sessions-crypto/ar-AA149tTz) at the conference but canceled shortly beforehand. Harrumph...

- **Ava Labs President John Wu** estimated it make two to three years for the crypto industry to repair the loss of public faith engendered by the FTX meltdown. Ouch.

- **OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer** said he sees gaming and the recent inclusion of non-fungible tokens on mainstream platforms like Reddit and Instagram as [potential catalysts](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/can-gaming-resurrect-the-nft-market-opensea-thinks-so/) to drive a revival in the broader NFT market. Monthly industrywide trading volume in NFTs was flat in September but is off 82% from its all-time high set in January, according to [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/111151/nft-market-sales-solana-ethereum).

- **TechCrunch reporters Anita Ramaswamy and Jacquelyn Melinek** chatted onstage about their perspective covering the FTX debacle, including mention of some hilarious Twitter exchanges [with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried](https://twitter.com/peteramckay/status/1593265485289766915). Their conversation isn't online yet but should be available soon on their podcast [Chain Reaction](https://techcrunch.com/tag/chain-reaction-podcast/).  

- **Of course, it wouldn't have been a TechCrunch event** without a startup [pitch competition](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/16/meet-the-startups-competing-at-tc-sessions-crypto/). The web3 gaming data company [Moonstream](https://docs.moonstream.to/) came away victorious in the one at TC Sessions: Crypto.

- **The privacy-focused blockchain** [String](https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1593306940758794242) had a friendly robot [roaming the expo area](https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1593306940758794242) of the conference. Awww...
