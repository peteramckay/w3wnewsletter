**At last.** Ethereum's long-awaited Merge [went into effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/technology/ethereum-merge-crypto.html) late Wednesday PDT, moving the network to a greener, more secure method for verifying transactions on its blockchain.

This upgrade, formally known as Ethereum 2.0, is undoubtedly a major milestone for the web3 movement as a whole. Hence there was much coverage of it by both [mainstream](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2022/09/15/nightcap-merge-ethereum-clip-orig.cnn/video/playlists/business-nightcap/) news outlets and [crypto press](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/the-ethereum-merge-is-done-did-it-work/) last week.

Some highlights:  

- **The Verge reports** that the Ethereum network’s electricity use is expected to [plunge 99.988%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/ethereum-just-completed-the-merge-e2-80-94-here-e2-80-99s-how-much-energy-it-e2-80-99s-saving/ar-AA11RCxx) post-Merge. Digiconomist is making a similar projection, including [this eye-popping chart](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption). New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose [mused](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/technology/merge-ethereum-crypto.html) that Ethereum's environmental improvement could bolster the general public's perception of the crypto industry as a whole -- though it still has other problems, to be sure.

- **ETH miners are scrambling for alternatives.** The new proof-of-stake protocol in Ethereum 2.0 is much less profitable for miners than the old proof-of-work system's rewards for verifying transactions. Some ETH miners are switching to other coins, Decrypt [reports](https://decrypt.co/109136/how-ethereum-miners-plan-to-pivot-after-the-merge). Meanwhile, *no* proof of work-based coin is profitable at this point for miners in California once power costs are factored in, according to [PC Magazine](https://www.pcmag.com/news/no-one-is-profitable-gpu-mining-faces-dark-days-after-ethereum-merge).

- **ETH's price sagged after the Merge,** leaving the token down 17% for the week through Saturday evening. However, the token is still well off its June lows, up 64% to trade above $1,400 recently, according to data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). CNBC [reports](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/15/ether-plunges-merge-hedge-funds-bet-against-bitcoin-competitor-crypto-world.html) that anticipation of the Merge boosted ETH through the summer, but hedge funds have recently been shorting the token now that the upgrade is complete.

- **Users shouln't expect the Merge to improve transaction speeds or lower fees quite yet,** according to [Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/lower-costs-higher-speeds-after-ethereum-s-merge-don-t-count-on-it). Those benefits, which are high on the wishlists of many Ethereum users, may take months longer to materialize, depending on additional iterations planned for the network's software.

- **The Wall Street Journal reports** that the [Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ethers-new-staking-model-could-draw-sec-attention-11663266224) whether the returns offered by proof-of-stake protocols turn such tokens into securities under U.S. law. If so, that would trigger new regulations for ETH and other PoW coins.

- **Issuers of non-fungible tokens sought to commemorate the Merge,** turning both Ethereum's last proof-of-work block and its first proof-of-stake block [into NFTs](https://forkast.news/headlines/ethereums-pow-pos-nfts-minted-eth/). The tokens drew [little interest](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/15/high-bid-on-nft-of-ethereums-final-pow-block-is-just-one-third-what-creators-paid-to-mint-it/) from bidders, however.
