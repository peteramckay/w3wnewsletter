**I've been thinking** about ways to make the newsletter more sustainable, while maintaining my goal to make info about decentralization accessible for newbie and [OG](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/OG) alike. A quick note here about two options if you'd like to help.

Most important, I'm looking for new sponsors. If your organization has an event to promote to the #Web3Weekly community, [as TechCrunch did](https://mailchi.mp/7321a83e16e1/web3-weekly-20274504) in late 2022, that's a great option. Or if it's some other product or service, that's cool too. Please drop me an email at peter@w3w.media, and we'll talk more.   

For individuals, below are a few crypto addresses where you can send donations, if that's of interest:

- **Bitcoin:** 3DWyDijmAm2o7k1bPQfTER1gK1JwnkcMEe
- **Ether (or any ERC20 token):** 0x2618bb798D7D7F12737dC47089355dd7Bab6F52D
- **Telos (EVM):** 0x4a6bd10b6d608c4891a58f48163ecc67775c2f13

Finally, thank you to everyone who has subscribed to the newsletter so far. I've always viewed this newsletter as a document of my own trip down the proverbial rabbit hole of learning about decentralization, piece by piece. It's always a pleasure and an honor to have friends along for the ride. ☺️

On to the latest headlines: 

The week's notable headlines:

- **Kraken will end staking for U.S. customers** and [pay a $30 million fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/09/crypto-exchange-kraken-settles-with-sec-over-us-staking-operation.html) to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was offering unregistered securities. The deal could set a precedent that will affect [other crypto exchanges](https://www.theblock.co/post/210587/kraken-crypto-industry-on-notice-gensler) as U.S. regulators increasingly look for areas where they can apply existing law to the industry.

- **Genesis filed a plan** in U.S. bankruptcy court to [repay its biggest creditors](https://www.yahoo.com/now/bankrupt-genesis-unveils-plan-pay-231004755.html), including provisions to enable customers of its partner Gemini to [recoup $900 million](https://decrypt.co/121100/bankrupt-genesis-plan-pay-creditors).

- **PayPal held $604 million** in crypto on behalf of users as of year-end 2022, according to its latest [annual report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001633917/b562e712-8266-493c-8ae8-e28f93404d2f.pdf). PayPal CEO Dan Schulman also said [he will retire](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/09/paypal-ceo-dan-schulman-to-leave-at-end-of-2023-company-begins-search-for-successor.html) later this year.

- **The research firm Chainalysis** says hackers [swiped $3.8 billion](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking/?ftag=MSFd61514f) from users in 2022, a new record. Much of the activity documented by Chainalysis came from North Korea, which effectively uses crypto theft to raise revenue beyond the reach of Western sanctions.

- **The Uniswap community** completed its final vote to deploy the latest version of their decentralized finance software [on the Binance-led BNB Chain](https://www.theblock.co/post/210570/uniswap-dao-completes-vote-for-proposed-bnb-deployment). CoinDesk notes that the outcome was a [rare setback](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/10/uniswap-vote-on-bnb-deployment-ends-with-silicon-valleys-a16z-on-losing-side/) for venture giant Andreesen Horowitz, which cast a large bloc of votes against the deployment.

- **Emergent Fidelity Technologies,** an offshore company co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried that holds almost $600 million in Robinhood stock, [filed for bankruptcy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/bankman-fried-entity-that-owns-robinhood-stake-goes-bankrupt#xj4y7vzkg) Friday.

- **Wall Street investment firms** still have [big crypto plans](https://decrypt.co/120546/financial-institutions-still-betting-crypto) despite market losses in 2022, Decrypt reports.

- **Google has begun** early user testing for Bard, a chatbot the company is [planning for a wider launch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-has-a-new-rival-googles-bard-chatbot/) soon to [compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/08/google-bard-heres-more-of-what-the-chatgpt-competitor-can-do.html).

- **The streaming service Twitch** suspended an AI-generated version of the sitcom Seinfeld for 14 days after it began [broadcasting transphobic jokes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/02/06/ai-generated-seinfeld-banned-from-twitch-after-making-transphobic-jokes/).

- **Yuga Labs settled** a civil suit against the developer of a marketplace for non-fungible tokens that Yuga says [infringed on its trademarks](https://www.theblock.co/post/208873/bayc-creator-yuga-labs-settles-trademark-infringement-lawsuit) for the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The company is still seeking damages from other individuals who worked on the marketplace project, according to The Block.

- **Crypto ads will be a no-show** for today's Super Bowl telecast, marking [a big reversal](https://apnews.com/article/kansas-city-chiefs-philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-sports-fox-corp-5d9922047c7fb640ddbf8caf5100ece2) from last year's "Crypto Bowl," according to the Associated Press. Instead, viewers will notice a bigger presence for an old Super Bowl standby: alcohol ads.
