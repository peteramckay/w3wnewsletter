# Tokenomics check
## #Web3Weekly: June 18-24, 2023

**For the first time in two years,** bitcoin's valuation represented [more than half](https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-dominance-hits-two-year-high-at-51-jeopardizing-altcoin-gains-202306211302) the global token market on Wednesday.

Honestly, the persistence of so-called "bitcoin dominance" has me re-thinking the future of web3 a bit.

I used to think that a maturation of web3 would necessarily lead to a more diversified mix of tokens with significant market share competing with one another. But now I increasingly suspect a concentrated market is here to stay for the long-term, with everyone just building on top of the couple of tokens that truly have significant share.

It's worth mentioning here that if we add ether into the mix alongside BTC, they represent 70% of the market combined, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) data. That's *a lot* considering the site tracks prices for more than 25,000 tokens.

Perpetual nerdfights between Bitcoin and Ethereum people aside, the admirable characteristics that both projects share is that they're open sourced under permissive licenses. They also have pretty decentralized ownership, with relatively little involvement by Big Tech.

If we zoom out, those are all traits of a more democratic, fair web than the one we currently have. So if just those two tokens remain the chief building blocks of web3 for the long haul, maybe that's OK after all.
