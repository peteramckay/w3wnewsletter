**It was a profoundly scary week** for decentralized and traditional finance alike.

Silicon Valley Bank shut down on Friday, the largest failure of a U.S. bank since the financial crisis of 2008. A classic [bank run](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp) ultimately did in SVB, but that was really the last straw in a longer series of misfortunes.

Some useful context from the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/svb-financial-pulls-capital-raise-explores-alternatives-including-possible-sale-sources-say-11de7522):

> *SVB’s deposits boomed alongside the tech industry, rising 86% in 2021 to $189 billion and peaking at $198 billion a quarter later. The bank poured large amounts of the deposits into U.S. Treasurys and other government-sponsored debt securities. Soon after, the Fed began increasing rates.*

> Rising rates and the tech downturn caused deposits to decline, spurring the bank to sell substantially all of its available-for-sale securities.*

SVB recently announced plans to restructure its balance sheet. But that ultimately backfired, according to [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90864105/silicon-valley-bank-shut-down-what-happens-next?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter):

> *Late Wednesday, SVB said it was hoping to raise $2.25 billion via a stock sale and investments in order to strengthen its balance sheet, as deposits from startups struggling for funding have dropped in recent months. That spooked both customers and, more importantly, venture capitalists, many of whom advised their clients to pull their money from the bank.*

> *As word of that advice leaked out, other customers began to pull money out at a phenomenal rate. SVB had reportedly hired an adviser to explore a possible sale, but with the run on the bank happening, it found itself at risk of collapse. That’s when California and the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.] stepped in, closing SVB and creating the new Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara, which took over all insured deposits at SVB.*

SVB thus became the biggest bank to be rescued by FDIC since [Washington Mutual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mutual) in the early days of the 2008 financial crisis.

It's of course never good when comparisons to that sad chapter come into play. It also doesn't help that SVB's meltdown happened on the heels of recent struggles at other firms like investment bank [Credit Suisse](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-delays-publication-annual-report-following-sec-call-2023-03-09/) and crypto bank [Silvergate](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23631320/silvergate-wind-down-liquidiation-announcement) as well.

People naturally wonder whether a similar global contagion to 2008 could take hold now, spilling into the "real economy" of factories and shopping malls and corner stores and other tangible stuff in everyday life.

The consensus for now seems to be ["probably not."](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/major-bank-failed-why-not-220527304.html) But that doesn't necessarily mean all is well either. There is, after all, a wide spectrum of plausible near-term scenarios between "2008-style armageddon" and "bull market."

Here are the best stories I've been reading about the risks ahead:
