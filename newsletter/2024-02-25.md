# Odds & Ends

- <!-- Draft: The Statewide News Collective, a community of practice for independent news organizations, has launched an impact research project with Montana Free Press, New Hampshire Public Radio, and Bridge Michigan. Led by George Washington University professor Danny Hayes, the project will measure the community and civic benefits of statewide accountability newsrooms. Each organization will receive an $8,000 grant for their participation and a detailed report on the impact of their work. The research aims to better understand the broader community and civic benefits of statewide journalism and create a publicly available resource for other organizations.
