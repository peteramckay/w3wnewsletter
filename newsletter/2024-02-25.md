Will need to update this later in the week. Some string...

- The price of Ether (ETH) surpassed $3,000 for the first time since April as excitement grows around the potential approval of a spot ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. ETH has risen over 12% in the past week and nearly 30% this year, outperforming Bitcoin as traders anticipate regulatory approval of an ETH ETF could boost investment from institutional investors similar to how new Bitcoin ETFs launched last month. Analysts predict ETH could continue rising to over $3,500 in the next month based on this momentum. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/20/ether-hits-3k-for-first-time-in-nearly-2-years-amid-rising-eth-etf-excitement/

- Hong Kong is moving forward with legislation for stablecoins and over-the-counter (OTC) virtual asset services. This follows ongoing public consultations by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The government aims to submit bills for these licensing regimes to the Legislative Council as soon as possible, according to Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui. This development aligns Hong Kong with other jurisdictions around the world looking to sharpen their crypto industry approach. https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/02/21/hong-kong-doubles-down-on-stablecoin-otc-rules-promise/ | https://www.theblock.co/post/278333/hong-kong-otc-stablecoin-crypto-consultation-bills | https://www.theblock.co/post/278300/hong-kong-lays-out-provisional-guidance-for-crypto-custody

- **AI updates:** NYT on Anthropic funding: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/technology/anthropic-funding-ai.html | Microsoft is investing $2.1 billion in Spain over the next two years to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud infrastructure. The majority of the funds will be used to establish a 'Cloud Region' with data centers in Madrid and AragÃ³n.
