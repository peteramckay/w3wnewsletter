**Even in a relatively subdued week of trading,** the token market saw some important milestones:

- **Ether's price rallied above $3,000** for the first time in nearly two years. The buying was fueled in part by rising optimism that an exchange-traded fund on the token will be approved by U.S. regulators this year. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-eth-price-hits-3k-for-the-first-time-since-2022))

- **Bitcoin was steady for the week versus the U.S. dollar,** recently trading above $51,000 per token. But rising institutional demand this year, combined with fluctuations in conventional foreign exchange markets, have recently pushed bitcoin's price to fresh all-time highs in terms of the local currencies of 14 countries. Combined, those countries have a population over 1 billion people and gross domestic product over $7 trillion a year, according to a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1760638270462104048) Thursday by crypto investor Balaji Srinivasan. Wow...

- **Global valuation** of the token market inched above $2 trillion, up 1.5% on the week and within reach of a 2-year high, according to CoinMarketCap data.
