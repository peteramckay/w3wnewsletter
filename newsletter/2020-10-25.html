      <p><strong>Mass adoption is still the holy grail of the blockchain space.</strong> When will millions of "normies," not just a relatively small but dedicated band of geeks, use blockchain technology to complete everyday tasks? What tools do we need to make this happen? Which companies will be the winners and losers?</p>

      <p>At least some of those answers are coming into focus, I think. We're still in the early stages of the big transition, to be sure. But the latest news is really promising, to the point it seems we're entering a genuinely new phase:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>PayPal said it would add crypto features covering four popular tokens.</strong> Users will soon have the ability to send and receive Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. They'll also be able to pay for goods and services via PayPal's network of 26 million merchants. (CNBC) <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3wex5vj">https://tinyurl.com/y3wex5vj</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Bitcoin had a banner week.</strong> Crypto world's flagship token rallied to new yearly highs above $13,000, boosted primarily by PayPal's announcement. Several less-heralded developments helped as well. In an interview with CNBC, prominent money manager <strong>Paul Tudor Jones</strong> discussed at length his move to allocate a small percentage of his portfolio to bitcoin, hailing it as the best hedge against inflation risk currently available. (<em>See the full interview at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y5wusq2d">https://tinyurl.com/y5wusq2d</a></em>) Separately, <strong>Mode Global Holdings</strong>, a London-based fintech company, joined a growing list of public companies who have announced public plans to hold bitcoin as an asset in their company cash reserves. (<em>See full coverage from CoinDesk at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2s9reae">https://tinyurl.com/y2s9reae</a></em>)</li>

        <li><strong>The main deposit contract for Ethereum 2.0 is now expected to launch in November, a key milestone in the network's long anticipated upgrade.</strong> The main deposit contract is a one-way Ethereum smart contract that holds staked ether tokens necessary for network security. Once fully implemented, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will allow much faster transactions thanks to a new "proof of stake" method of verification. (CoinDesk) <em>Link: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-2-0-deposit-contract-delayed-november">https://tinyurl.com/y65ypd4z</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against Google alleging antitrust violations.</strong> Echoing concerns previously pursued by European regulators, a key element of DOJ's suit is Google's pressure on its partners to set its search engine as the default on Americans' mobile devices. (<em>Full text of the DOJ's suit is available at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y35xhn8g">https://tinyurl.com/y35xhn8g</a></em>) Separately, the Washington Post's <strong>Geoffrey A. Fowler</strong> took a look at how Google's search results have changed over the years in ways that adversely affect competitors. <em>Link: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/">https://tinyurl.com/yxsvdag6</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>The Financial Stability Board</strong>, an international body of central bankers that that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, issued a <strong>new report on oversight of stablecoins</strong>. Fans of such tokens hope the research may provide needed clarity to additional countries weighing whether to launch official digital currencies. <em>Link: <a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/regulation-supervision-and-oversight-of-global-stablecoin-arrangements/">https://tinyurl.com/y4g2qlpa</a></em></li>



        <li>Speaking at a regulators' summit in Shanghai, Alibaba and Ant Group founder <strong>Jack Ma</strong> urged major reform of global financial rules. His remarks come ahead of Ant Group's initial public offering of stock, which is expected to value the company between $35 billion and $45 billion when trading begins this week. (South China Morning Post) <em>Link: <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3106949/jack-ma-urges-financial-regulation-reform-eve-ant-groups">https://tinyurl.com/yxne46ur</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>Several U.S. senators are calling for a probe</strong> of the border patrol's recently revealed use of a service that discloses users' phone location data without obtaining a warrant. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yylrkam3">https://tinyurl.com/yylrkam3</a></em></li>


        <li><strong>The Freedom of the Press Foundation added a new criterion to its scorecard tracking news organizations' adoption of encryption technologies.</strong> The foundation will now also track whether publishers have adopted "onion services," or censorship-resistant, privacy-optimized versions of their websites for the encrypted Tor newtwork. <em>Link: <a href="https://freedom.press/news/onions-side-tracking-tor-availability-reader-privacy-major-news-sites/">https://tinyurl.com/y5q9ppxe</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Consensys published some handy tips for GitHub users</strong> to avoid uploading private keys and other sensitive information to the popular code-sharing service. <em>Link: <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-development/how-to-avoid-uploading-your-private-key-to-github-approaches-to-prevent-making-your-secrets-public/?utm_campaign=ConsenSys%20Diligence&utm_content=142718311&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-3129477561">https://tinyurl.com/y3n8zz2w</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Inrupt released a software development kit for React</strong>. The startup, which was co-founded by web inventor <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, focuses on "semantic markup" technologies that enable websites to share data using open standards rather than siloed services. <em>Link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/468132352">https://tinyurl.com/yy3zg5bz</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Room 77, a legendary bar among bitcoiners</strong> as the first place a beer was bought with the token, is closing. The Berlin watering hole survived several bear markets in crypto, but was ultimately done in by COVID-related restrictions on social gatherings, writes CoinDesk's <strong>Colin Harper</strong>. Damn. <em>Link: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y63j748p">https://tinyurl.com/y63j748p</a></em></li>

        <li><strong>Finally, a special Halloween shout-out</strong> to the guy in upstate New York who'd rigged up a custom-built giant spider that actually climbs up and down a web over the front of his house. I bow down to your combination of holiday spirit and epic Home Depot skillz, sir. <em>Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1316099588584071168">https://tinyurl.com/y57h43bp</a></em></li>
