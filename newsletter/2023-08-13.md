# NFTs 101
## #Web3Weekly: Aug. 6-12, 2023

**If there's one blockchain-related topic** that newbies find less-than-intuitive, I'd have to say it tends to be non-fungible tokens. Thus it seems like a good topic for the newsletter's summer series highlighting good videos about the basics of web3.

In 2021, video journalist Johnny Harris published a plain-English [explainer about NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz9zw7-_vhM) that holds up well even today. No surprise, considering his channel is a great one for making understandable various other extremely complicated, non-crypto topics as well. These include everything from [Taiwanese national security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNZ0so0LCoM) to the workings of [U.S. economic sanctions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ppy3dVz8c) to why the McDonald's ice cream maker is [always out of order](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrDEtSlqJC4).

Johnny's NFT piece won't necessarily make a digital art collector out of you. But it will at least give you a solid overview, so you'll understand what all the fuss over NFTs is about. (Plus you'll be more apt to get the jokes next time Saturday Night Live does [a skit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc) on the topic. ☺️)

[ICYMI](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=icymi) here are my earlier picks in the "web3 basics" series:

<!-- Items below could use some writethrough for concision, etc... -->

- Wired magazine's explainer [Wired magazine's explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0&t=49s) of "what is blockchain," tailored so even a five-year old can understand it.

- [Author Ben Mezrich telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN96Dgih3gI) the "making of" backstory behind his book [Bitcoin Billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Billionaires-Genius-Betrayal-Redemption/dp/1250217741/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1), a classic history of the crypto market's early days.

- On Ethereum's recent eighth anniversary, Fortune discussed the network's [past, present, and future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKmbxd4MQmk&t=618s). <!-- In less than 15 minutes, reporter Rosemarie Miller covers a *lot* of ground about the platform's history and its future through her chat with blockchain entrepreneur Jamiel Shiekh. -->

_**That's it for now! Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_
