# Counting down...
## #W3W: Dec. 24-30, 2023

**It's difficult to overstate** how negative the popular narrative about crypto was at this time a year ago.

The scars of FTX's meltdown in late 2022 were still fresh, muddying layman investors' perceptions of the industry as a whole. Even among crypto-industry veterans, there was much fretting about how long "crypto winter" might last -- and how deep the losses might run. To boot, absolutely everyone worried the Federal Reserve's efforts to curtail U.S. inflation might tip the world's biggest economy into recession in 2023.

So what happened? Now that we've reached New Year's Eve, we know the answer.

In 2023, token prices roared higher. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud charges and very deservedly imprisoned. The Fed's rate hikes peaked. And there was no U.S. recession. <!-- Add links to relevant news coverage of each milestone. -->

More in a moment about how we collectively pulled off this little miracle -- and what comes next. But first let's get to the year-end scorecard among major market benchmarks, listed from best performers to worst for 2023.

Get into themes for '24.

- Bitcoin seems likely to benefit from a three-legged stool of awesomeness.

- But altcoins are dying.

- There will be no relief from Congress.

- The web3 product roadmap is still very uncertain. Look at underperformance of Ethereum.

- Popular attention is on AI more than crypto.

Notes/cutting room floor...

**Hard to believe** that at this time last year, the crypto industry was reeling from FTX's then-recent meltdown, token prices were in the doldrums, everyone was worried how long 'Crypto Winter' might last, and there were rampant fears of a U.S. recession in 2023.

Now FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is a convicted felon, token prices just wrapped up a banner year, and everyone is marveling the U.S. somehow avoided recession all year. (But much of Wall Street is still worried about the potential for one in 2024.)

The debt ceiling deal has put us on a long-term path toward a U.S. debt default. https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/28/6-pillars-of-the-debt-ceiling-deal-00099108


**Whew.** Time to look back at the surprising year that was and ahead to 2024 and beyond.
