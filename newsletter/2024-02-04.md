Lead item. ~450 words. Some possibilities:

Picture yourself as a bigwig at a for-profit news organization. Now also picture two emerging software technologies, promising but unproven in your industry.

One will answer verbal queries akin to those you might pose to another human being. But it hallucinates sometimes and, even when its answers are sane, consistently refuses to attribute where it learned what it "knows."

The other is a reinvention of the financial system, as well as a new platform atop which applications can be built. Over the last 15 years, it's grown to represent a new ecosystem worth trillions of dollars, even as the valuation of U.S. media companies has tanked. To boot, this technology has reached these milestones without participation by Big Tech -- the same platforms that have effectively destroyed the traditional business model for media.

Which one do you think has more applications for journalism?

- MEDIA: Web3 tk.

- BUKELE: This re-election, which exceeds his term limit, is final confirmation he is a dictator. There's nothing cool about that.

- BIGTECH: The latest hearing in which senators railed against Big Tech is as much about context and subtext.

- DIGESTING: Software is digesting the world.
