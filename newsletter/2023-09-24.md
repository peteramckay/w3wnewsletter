# Bitcoin's global use cases
## #Web3Weekly: Sept. 17-23, 2023

**Cointelegraph's Joe Hall just returned from Cuba,** where he attended the island's first big bitcoin meetup. (Or at least the first one that an English-language journalist with a video camera was present for.)

[Hall's report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPp0Xbk4bFo) from the trip is eye-opening stuff indeed. In particular, I highly recommend it to anyone from a rich country who has a strong opinion on bitcoin, pro or con.

Some context: Cuba is undergoing a serious economic crisis right now, including a sharp currency devaluation. Reuters reported last month that inflation is running at [45% a year](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-struggle-peso-loses-half-its-value-year-informal-market-2023-08-02/), with the Cuban peso recently trading at 230 pesos to one U.S. dollar.

Anecdotally, Hall's sources in Cuba estimated on-camera that the peso's purchasing power is now just one-eighth what it was against the U.S. dollar two years ago.

In that sort of currency collapse, which has no real parallel in U.S. history, people might look for an alternative form of money to trust. And maybe it's bitcoin.

We've recently seen similar situations in Argentina and Venezuela. El Salvador, Nigeria, and Montserrat.




This sort of situation is inconceivable in a country like the U.S., where the currency is widely accepted and most people trust conventional, regulated banks.  





As an American, I feel like much of bitcoin skepticism I hear at home is rooted in a lack of empathy for societies that don't necessarily resemble our own. We live in a country where our currency is widely accepted, our banks are regulated, and public courts enforce contracts pretty strictly.

It's easy for people  








###1. The BTC token is money conjured out of thin air, with no intrinsic value.

###2. Using the Bitcoin network is risky compared to the protections of conventional banks.

###3. You can't really spend or use BTC for anything.

*Everyone isn't like you, and the circumstances where they live might be wildly different from the ones you take for granted in your country.*




In 2 years, the Cuban peso is worth 1/8 what it was against the USD, according to the video.
