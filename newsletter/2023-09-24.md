# Bitcoin's global use cases
## #Web3Weekly: Sept. 17-23, 2023

**Cointelegraph's Joe Hall just returned from Cuba,** where he attended the island's first big bitcoin meetup. (Or at least the first one that an English-language journalist with a video camera was present for.)

[Hall's report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPp0Xbk4bFo) from the trip is eye-opening stuff indeed. In particular, I highly recommend it to anyone from a rich country who has a strong opinion on bitcoin, pro or con.

Some context: Cuba is undergoing a serious economic crisis right now, including a sharp currency devaluation. Reuters reported last month that inflation is running at [45% a year](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-struggle-peso-loses-half-its-value-year-informal-market-2023-08-02/), with the Cuban peso recently changing hands at 230 pesos to one U.S. dollar.

That sort of instability wreaks absolute havoc on every aspect of daily economic life, from buying groceries to retirement saving. We've seen similar narratives in several other countries that have had heavy bitcoin adoption like [Argentina](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-hits-new-highs-in-argentina/) and [Venezuela](https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-numbers-cryptocurrency-adoption-factors/).

For people in countries like the U.S., where I live, such dire scenarios tend to be unfathomable. We tend to take for granted that the dollar reigns supreme, that it's widely accepted for payments, that the nearest bank branch will open on time everyday, and that our deposits will be safe there for when we need them.

For bitcoin skeptics in the rich world, it's worth remembering that [not everyone](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/is-it-way-more-risky-to-hold-fiat-in-latin-america-and-africa-than-crypto/ar-AA1h7WNZ) enjoys such everyday certainties. And some people who don't might seek out an alternative monetary system like the Bitcoin network, for [perfectly rational reasons](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/how-fiat-currency-crises-drive-nations-toward-cryptocurrencies/).

For pro-bitcoiners as well, it's always worth noting that several real-world monetary crises like Cuba's exist *right now*. Perhaps it would be a more effective argument to win people over to point out these very tangible situations versus theorizing about how the dominant USD-based banking system is headed toward collapse any day now.

Hey, you might eventually prove right about the latter. I've [criticized the USD-based system](https://peteramckay.medium.com/crypto-vs-mmt-competing-visions-of-how-money-should-work-410f4b7da381) myself [at times](https://peteramckay.medium.com/of-course-this-is-mmt-fde064179528). But the unavoidable reality is that people tend to believe more readily in what they can see with their own two eyes today.

So *show* them, as Hall deftly did in Cuba. Don't merely tell them.
