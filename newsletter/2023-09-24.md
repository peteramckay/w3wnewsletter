**Novelist James Baldwin** gave my all-time favorite quote about the craft of writing. It comes from a 1984 interview with the [Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2994/the-art-of-fiction-no-78-james-baldwin):

*"When you’re writing, you’re trying to find out something which you don’t know. The whole language of writing for me is finding out what you don’t want to know, what you don’t want to find out. But something forces you to anyway."*

In its own way, this humble newsletter has always proceeded in that vein. When I was working my first marketing gig at a crypto startup in San Francisco [two crypto winters](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=crypto%20winter) ago, I went down the proverbial "rabbit hole" to rapidly pick up what I needed to know about blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralization in general.

It was fascinating, heady stuff. I also quickly realized the vast majority of *everyone else* were also beginners at this subject matter. So I started documenting my own journey here, sharing the information I was consuming in hope it might be useful to others as well.

Along the way, I've also learned a few things I didn't really want to know, as Baldwin would say. Things that were unpleasant, that I initially had some resistance to but have come to accept.

One such thing I've (mostly) made peace with is the lop-sided concentration of the token market's valuation, which I now believe is [here to stay](https://mailchi.mp/3627b3887115/web3-weekly-20312576). As long as the handful of dominant protocols are open source and transparent, with decentralized control, I think we should be OK in the long run. That scenario would represent a big improvement over the current version of the web, which is basically defined by all sorts of proprietary limitations and choke points created by Big Tech.  

I see the token market as a four-part affair, really. When I consume news day-to-day about crypto at this point, this is essentially the hierarchy I run through in my head to prioritize how important any breaking story is.

I'll include here the market share that each of the four parts has within the token ecosystem's global valuation of $1 trillion, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) data:

### Bitcoin (48%)

The oldest and most widely held token by far. Designed to be the ultimate form of digital money, though some developers have put it to [funkier uses](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-ordinals-a-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-nfts) lately. You all know this one. Let's move on...

### Ethereum (19%)

Designed to work as a platform for decentralized apps (dApps). Yes, there are several networks that aspire to compete with it now. But keep in mind, *all of them combined* still aren't as big as Ethereum.

Honestly, I've begun wondering whether the widespread developer adoption of ETH has reached the point of a network effect that constitutes an insurmountable advantage to any other dApp platform ever gaining majority market share. In other words, people use it -- and will almost inevitably continue to use it, regardless of some technical shortcomings -- for no other reason beyond the fact that other people use it. But who knows. Time will tell.

### Unicorn Stablecoins (11%)

Here we get into our first multi-coin category. I lump into it all the stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar with over $1 billion in market capitalization, using that as a rough measure of real traction among users.

This "unicorn" club comprises [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) ($83 billion valuation), [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/) ($26 billion), [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/) ($5 billion), and [TruUSD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trueusd/) ($3 billion).

As partisans of one stablecoin or another will surely point out, there's a separate conversation to be had about the different ways each token implements its peg to the U.S. dollar and reports its reserves to the public. Let it suffice for now that when we start talking stablecoins, we immediately confront scenarios with more centralization and less transparency than the Bitcoin/Ethereum duopoly at the top of the crypto market.

Nevertheless, I believe it generally makes sense for users and journalists to think of the big stablecoins as a group because they all are intended to play essentially the same economic role in the marketplace, acting as bridges between conventional finance and the on-chain world.

### Everything Else (22%)

I won't use the common term "altcoin" here, because industry folks have traditionally used it to mean "everything that's not bitcoin." That usage worked well enough in the very early days of cryptocurrencies, but my hunch is it's a little antiquated at this point, especially in regard to Ethereum.

That token should now be regarded as a basic feature of the crypto firmament, in my opinion, so it's not really so "alt" anymore. It's not going anywhere, almost as certainly as bitcoin isn't.

That said, there's still plenty of "everything else" to go around even without Ethereum. CoinMarketCap now tracks over 8,000 tokens.
