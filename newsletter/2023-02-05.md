*"Bitcoin and Chill" by Peter A. McKay × DALL·E*

**It is difficult to tell** which is growing faster right now, consumers' use of artificial intelligence apps or the number of articles about AI's potential pitfalls.

ChatGPT, the popular bot made by Open AI, just topped 100 million monthly active users two months after launching. Analysts say that's the [fastest path](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/) to that milestone of any app in history.

At the same time, fretful articles like [this one](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/31/1067436/could-chatgpt-do-my-job/) from the MIT Technology Review have become a cottage industry undo themselves. The headline says it all:

*"Could ChatGPT do my job?"*

Along similar lines, Wired covered [artists' complaints](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-generative-ai-art-according-to-artists/) that visual AI tools like Midourney and DALL-E don't give explicit credit to the creators whose prior works the software effectively mimics. And OpenAI itself now offers a tool to help educators to [spot ChatGPT-powered cheating](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/openai-rolls-out-new-tool-to-combat-chatgpt-plagiarism/444096) on writing assignments.

Optimistically, I'd like to think this all signals that we've collectively learned an important lesson over time -- that it's important to ask tough questions *early* in the adoption of a new technology before unintended consequences get out of hand. We didn't do that with social media, and look how that turned out.

On the other hand, it could be AI is just an exception. Maybe we have been conditioned to worry about it in particular through decades of sci-fi movies about murderous AIs.

There's even one such movie in theaters now that's been a [runaway hit](https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/box-office/avatar-the-way-of-water-tops-the-weekend-box-office-again-but-the-real-story-is-m3gan-blowing-past-predictions). A sequel is already [in the works](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/m3gan-2-0-sequel-2025-1234663375/), tentatively titled M3GAN 2.0.

In her book "Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity", she explains that digital devices such as smartphones and computers are largely to blame for the disruption to our attention. Notifications are one major source of distraction, but only account for half of the interruptions in focus. The other half are prompted by an internal motivation to switch tasks and Dr. Mark found that these urges to self-distract are caused by stress.(https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/well/mind/concentration-focus-distraction.html)
