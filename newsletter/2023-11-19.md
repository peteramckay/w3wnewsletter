**The power struggle that erupted Friday at OpenAI** is as chaotic as any I have ever seen at any company. To use a word that's become a personal favorite since the pandemic, we will not be able to *unsee* this anytime soon.

However the situation resolves over the next few days, the fact that it happened at all should remain crucial context through which we filter whatever comes next in OpenAI's evolution. The public and the press should treat this company with a much higher degree of skepticism going forward, and demand greater accountability and transparency.

The board and CEO, whoever they are when the dust settles, will inevitably make statements putting a happy face on the whole ruckus, because that's what companies do. They will spin it as just a big misunderstanding, you see. But now it will all be settled, the employees will be happy, and we can all just carry on our lives as before.

Don't buy it.

All this year, we've been told repeatedly that widespread use of artificial intelligence will be one of the biggest technological events in humankind's history, with potentially massive benefits but also risks on par with those of nuclear weapons.

Well, we just got a closer peek at the individuals ostensibly leading the charge on AI. That's why this matters so much.

Paradoxically, part of the challenge here may actually be to focus *less* on the miracle of AI technology itself when we discuss the implications. Instead focus more on the institutions involved, especially when they are venture-backed, for-profit companies.

Those are ultimately subject to very specific incentives and very human foibles that are mundane as can be. Yet those governance issues can profoundly affect how an emerging technology actually gets integrated into real people's lives. And no amount of [hand waving](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hand%20waving) can change that.

Some context: OpenAI has a valuation of around $90 billion on the private market. If it were an S&P 500 company, that would put it in the weight class of Schlumberger, CVS, and AT&T.

But we tend to discuss tech companies in a very different way than we would an oil driller, a drugstore chain, or or a phone carrier founded by Alexander Graham Bell in the 19th century, don't we?  

Regarding product, tech companies are of course different. But regarding regarding governance, they are really no different, subject to the same greed, careerism, and internal backstabbing as in any other industry.

To put it another way, yes, AI technology is rapidly evolving everyday in fascinating ways. But *people* remain very much the same. That's the real problem we have to reckon with.

For any emerging technology, it is inherently problematic.

Bullshit.






People have warned that the development of

**Everyone has been so keenly fascinated** by the "AI" part of OpenAI this year, perhaps we haven't talked enough about the "open" part.

There is no internal transparency, and the prospect of them becoming a hegemon corporate player in the business of AI, backed by the existing trillion-dollar hegemon that is Microsoft, could quickly cut off competition.




**I don't know Sam Altman personally,** I don't work at OpenAI, and I don't own shares in it. Do you?

If not, then you've probably been ill-served by the tidal wave of speculation in the press and on social media since Friday, when OpenAI's board [abruptly fired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/17/openai-ceo-resigns/) Altman as chief executive.

No question, it was shocking news. And the company's vague public statement citing communication issues between Altman and the board isn't satisfying anyone.

The technology, at its best, is damn near magical. The inner workings of a multi-billion dollar company never are. That part is banal as can be, every single time.





" And it was good.

**Artificial intelligence as a business and a product category** is a more freewheeling competition today than a week ago. That is unabashedly a good thing for most of us.






**There has been much magical talk** about artificial intelligence this year, about applications straight out of our favorite sci-fi movies that are supposedly imminent. But amid all that bloviation, one truly magical word has been almost entirely absent:

Competition.



They began life as a nonprofit and restructured as a venture-backed startup company. What did you think would happen? Something other than board drama, power grabs, and massive greed? Have you not seen this movie before?

<!-- Social networks...

As Twitter and Meta have stumbled, the number of new networks has mushroomed in a way that just wasn't happening when Facebook in particular was at its peak as a hegemon. Even older but smaller competitors like LinkedIn and Pinterest have gotten a second look from some users.

That's a *good* thing.


The c in VC stands for "capital," folks.




No one man should have all that power. Spread it around.

We're all seeing it in social media right now.  



A year ago, most people considered artificial intelligence a wild fantasy out of a sci-fi movie. Yes, that  




Bad for OpenAI, bad for Microsoft, and bad for Sam Altman.

But it's probably great for users.

It is unsavory.

We'll actually have competition and multiple products in the AI space, for longer, in a free-for-all where everyone benefits. Contrast this with the scenario where one player reached critical mass, effectively cornered the market, and then crushed any competition before it had a chance to get started.


This will be fine.




When I lived out in California, for run, I would sometimes poll tecchie friends about which Big Tech company is most apt to accidentally build an artificially intelligent Terminator. Frankly, the consensus pick was always Google. Some subgenre of corporate backstabbing.

I disagreed. My pick was Microsoft, because our would-be Terminator maker would have to not only have all the aforementioned advantages but also a propensity for new products to go awry in cartoonishly clunky, dysfunctional ways.

Microsoft.

Microsoft.





**We still don't really know why OpenAI abruptly fired** its high-profile chief executive officer Sam Altman on Friday evening. But that won't stop everyone from guessing.

- Microsoft has put 10B into the company, doesn't have a board seat, but owns 49% of the company.

- Three independent directors did this.

- Of course, investors who actually put money in OpenAI will likely kick out these board members and bring Sam back.  In the Igbo Nation, they say that white ants seem beautiful but no chicken likes to eat them. The implication is that it is not everything which glitters that is gold. Yes, ChatGPT may be glittering, but it takes uncommon visionaries to make it gold.
