**It blows my mind** that the asset chiefly responsible for wreaking havoc on banks' books right now [is U.S. Treasury bonds](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/business/treasury-market-swings-economic-signal.html), not anything akin to the [funky mortgage derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis) of the 2008 crisis. And it's certainly [not crypto](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/20/crypto-takeaways-from-recent-bank-failures/).

Treasury debt is supposed to be an utterly vanilla, low-risk investment. Uncle Sam's pockets are almost infinitely deep, according to the conventional wisdom. Thus investors traditionally assume the U.S. government will always be good for any money they lend it by buying its Treasury bonds.

Which brings us to [the current mess](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-banking-woes-fed-keep-110448314.html). So far, the banks that have failed or found themselves [on the brink](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/deutsche-bank-shares-slump-in-latest-sign-of-bank-worries/ar-AA191vOu) have mostly been guilty of [bad timing](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/silicon-valley-bank-svb-stock-price-bond-portfolio-firesale-treasury-2023-3) on their recent T-bond purchases, executed right before the Federal Reserve started selling Treasury debt furiously as part of its effort to fight inflation.

My friend Matt Phillips' [story for the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/business/banks-government-bonds.html) back in late 2021 illustrates the problem nicely. He described a "binge" among U.S. banks buying T-bonds at the time, including a record $150 billion purchased in the second quarter of 2021 alone.

Less than a year later, the Fed [started increasing](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/all-systems-go-feds-liftoff-us-interest-rates-2022-03-16/) its interest-rate target aggressively to combat inflation. That means the central bank's trading desk had to unload a bunch of T-bonds on the open market -- effectively putting the private-sector banks on the wrong end of the Fed's strategy.

Now the losses associated with that bad timing are truly coming home to roost for the banks, threatening their solvency in some cases. The troubled institutions have gotten heavy criticism for this in the press the last few weeks, much of it well-deserved and coming from peers in the financial industry. After all, why didn't the banks see a Fed policy change coming sooner and prepare accordingly?

Fair enough. But still...

I think it's also worth turning this criticism on its head for just a moment: Didn't *the Fed* realize it might break a lot of financial institutions and possibly invite a crisis by selling so many bonds so rapidly? Why didn't *it* prepare better, especially considering its ostensible role as [protector of stability](https://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability.htm) in the U.S. economy? Or did the Fed *not* figure this might happen, which would be disturbing in a whole other way?

You know, it's almost as if having a committee with a handful of members meet behind closed doors [eight times a year](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) to set the monetary policy of a modern, multi-trillion dollar economy might be an antiquated way to do it. If only someone would invent a more nimble, transparent, consistent method... 

Oh, [right](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper). 

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Police arrested** fugitive Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon [in Montenegro](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/do-kwon-arrest-terraluna-ustc-sdny-stablecoin/). He faces fraud charges in the U.S. in connection with the meltdown of Terraform's TeraUSD and Luna tokens, which cost investors more than $40 billion.

- **The Securities and Exchange Commission** filed a civil complaint alleging fraud by Tron founder Justin Sun and other violations by eight celebrities who plugged his companies [without proper disclosures](https://www.reuters.com/legal/sec-sues-justin-sun-others-over-illegal-crypto-sales-2023-03-22/). Most of the defendants immediately settled the charges by paying six-figure fines.

- **Coinbase said** the SEC has [issued it a Wells notice](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/we-asked-the-sec-for-reasonable-crypto-rules-for-americans-we-got-legal), which will likely be followed by enforcement action soon. Regulators have expressed concerned about some of the exchange's products, such as its staking service. But Coinbase said it hasn't been clear what changes it should make.

- **Bitcoin rose 1%** for the week despite market liquidity [hitting a 10-month low](https://decrypt.co/124554/bitcoin-liquidity-hits-10-month-low-us-banking-crisis). The exit of SVB and other troubled banks as links between traditional cash and crypto buying has [hampered](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/25/bitcoin-was-a-winner-during-the-us-banking-crisis-but-illiquidity-prevents-it-from-being-a-usd-hedge/) wider market participation.

- **Fight the power?** Slate's Luke Winkie published an [epic rant](https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/android-iphone-messaging-compatibility-problems.html) about anti-Android "discrimination" he's experienced. Hmmm...
