# A blockchain-y classic from Wired
## #Web3Weekly: July 9-15, 2023

**Today we start** our summer series highlighting videos about the basics of web3.

Our initial pick was easy: [an excellent explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0) published by Wired in 2017. In the video, entrepreneur Bettina Warburg covers what blockchain tech is at five levels of difficulty, from that of an actual five-year-old up to that of a fellow expert in the field.

Honestly, I'm still unsure what's more amazing about this video -- that it still holds up so well after several years or that it clearly conveys so much layman-friendly information *in less than 20 minutes.*

If you're just getting started with blockchain, the explainer that Warburg created for Wired is still a truly [fantastic starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0&t=2s).
