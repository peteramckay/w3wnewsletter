# Happy Birthday, ETH!
## #Web3Weekly: July 23-29, 2023

**Hard to believe,** but Ethereum just celebrated [the eighth anniversary](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/28/ethereums-8th-anniversary-ecosystem-leaders-share-insights/) of its main network launch.

Whereas Bitcoin was built strictly as a monetary system, Ethereum was designed from the outset to be a full-fledged app platform. Since its launch in 2019, the network's native token, dubbed "ether" or ETH for short, has grown to a $226 billion valuation, comprising 19% of the global token market, according to [CoinMarketCap data](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).

Forbes just posted a nice, layman-friendly discussion of [Ethereum's evolution so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKmbxd4MQmk&t=618s). In less than 15 minutes, reporter Rosemarie Miller covers a *lot* of ground about the platform's history and its future through her chat with blockchain entrepreneur Jamiel Shiekh.

As I'm focusing the newsletter this summer on high-quality videos covering the basics of web3, this Forbes post struck me as a great one to highlight. ICYMI here are the previous installments in the "basics" series:

- [Wired magazine's explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0&t=49s) of "what is blockchain," tailored so even a five-year old can understand it.

- [Author Ben Mezrich telling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN96Dgih3gI) the "making of" backstory behind his book Bitcoin Billionaires, a classic history of the crypto market's early days.

_**That's it for now! Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_
