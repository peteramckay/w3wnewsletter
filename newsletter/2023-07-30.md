# Happy Birthday, ETH!
## #Web3Weekly: July 23-29, 2023

**Hard to believe,** but Ethereum just celebrated [the eighth anniversary](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/28/ethereums-8th-anniversary-ecosystem-leaders-share-insights/) of its main network launch.

Whereas Bitcoin was built strictly as a monetary system, Ethereum was designed from the outset to be a full-fledged app platform. Since its launch in 2019, the network's native token, dubbed "ether" or ETH for short, has grown to a $226 billion valuation, comprising 19% of the global token market, according to [CoinMarketCap data](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/).

Forbes just posted a nice, layman-friendly discussion of [Ethereum's evolution so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKmbxd4MQmk&t=618s). Reporter Rosemarie Miller covers a lot of ground about the platform's history and its future in her chat with entrepreneur Jamiel Shiekh.

As I'm focusing the newsletter on web3 basics this summer, Ethereum was obviously an important topic to touch upon. Highlighting this video, which clocks in at less than 15 minutes, was a great way to do it, I think.

ICYMI here are the previous installments in the "basics" series:

- Wired magazine's 20-minute explainer of "what is blockchain," tailored so even a five-year old can understand it.

- Author Ben Mezrich telling the "making of" backstory behind his book Bitcoin Billionaires, a classic history of the crypto market's early days.
