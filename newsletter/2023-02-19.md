**The future of U.S. crypto regulation** just became a little clearer, but not necessarily prettier.

The pretty version would probably be for Congress to pass a law establishing a comprehensive legal framework for the industry. 

Sure, the significant

The sane version would be for

<!-- Re-top, rewrite to focus on regulation... -->

My view of U.S. crypto regulation comprises three main points:

1. The industry would ideally get a comprehensive framework that clarifies what it can and cannot do.
2. The basic dysfunction of Congress -- on everying -- precludes this from happening. This is a Congress where the two chambers are controlled by different parties, and the Speaker of the House lives in abject fear of getting booted from his job by even a single disgruntled member of his own caucus.
3. For the time being, applying old laws as they see fit.

- **New York state regulators ordered** Paxos to [stop minting](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/consumers/alerts/Paxos_and_Binance) the stablecoin Binance USD, citing concerns about the reserves backing the token. In a [statement to customers](https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/) on Monday, Paxos said it will continue to redeem their BUSD tokens for $1 each through at least February 2024, and that it is cutting ties to Binance, the exchange it partnered with on BUSD. The token is currently the eighth-largest in the world by market valuation, at $13.6 billion, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/).

- **The Securities and Exchange Commission charged** Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon [with fraud](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32) in connection with the meltdown of its Luna and TerraUSD tokens last year. The SEC says Kwon moved 10,000 bitcoin out of Terra into an offline wallet and cashed some of them out via a Swiss bank ahead of the fiasco. Kwon's whereabouts have been unknown since last fall, when Interpol [issued a "red notice"](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/business/interpol-do-kwon-korea-crypto.html) for his capture at the request of South Korean authorities.   

- **The SEC's complaint also asserts** that TerraUSD was an investment contract because users could earn yield on it through the platform Anchor.
Combined with the SEC's [recent settlement](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25) with Kraken regarding yield-generating accounts, this appears to be a new line of legal inquiry for the SEC that could become a big headache for the broader crypto industry, Forbes [reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/02/17/sec-claims-new-turf-in-lawsuit-against-terrausd-stablecoin-creator/).

- **The chairman of the U.S. House subcommittee** on digital assets [told CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/26/stablecoin-regulation-is-first-on-new-subcommittees-to-do-list-says-chairman/) that legislation to regulate stablecoins is a big priority for the group in the current congressional session.

- **Basketball Hall of Famer Paul Pierce** agreed to pay a $1.4 million fine to settle an SEC complaint that he [didn't disclose publicly](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/paul-pierce-paying-million-settlement-sec-cryptocurrency-violations-ethereummax/) that he was paid to promote EthereumMax. The fine is similar to one paid by Kim Kardashian last year, in a case clearly meant by the SEC to [send a message](https://www.theblock.co/post/212937/sec-warns-celebrities-after-charging-nba-hall-of-famer-over-crypto-promotion) to other celebrity endorsers.

- Separate crypto custody from exchange: () https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/26/crypto-laws-us-protect-consumers-custody-exchange-separation/

- Wyoming lawmakers passed a bill that prohibits forced disclosure of private keys. (https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/16/wyoming-lawmakers-pass-bill-prohibiting-forced-disclosure-of-private-crypto-keys/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines)

- Judge is threatening to throw Sam Bankman-Fried back in jail. () <!-- Need link... Meanwhile... All the people who chipped in to pay Sam Bankman-Fried's bail have ties to Stanford University. The incident is emblematic of why the traditional tech industry in Northern California is losing prestige, says TKTKTKTKTKT.

- Binance transferred 400M from a US partner to a CZ-controlled firm. Hmm... (https://www.theblock.co/post/212658/binance-transferred-400-million-from-u-s-partner-to-zhao-run-firm-reuters-says?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss)

- **Apple** has a [movie about Tetris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcfbg994fu4) in the works. WTF.
