        <br>

        <p><strong>One person all but single-handedly tanked crypto markets last week.</strong> That's a big problem, even more troublesome than the decline in token prices itself.</p>

        <p>A quick summary of the damage: Global crypto market showed a weekly decline of 9% to $2.25 trillion as of late Saturday. Leading the way lower were bitcoin (off 19%) and dogecoin (off 17%), according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">CoinMarketCap data</a>.</p>

        <p>Enter Elon Musk. <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/05/elon-musk-snl-dogecoin-weekend-update-hodl.html">DOGE's woes started</a> right after the billionaire's gig hosting Saturday Night Live on May 8, which included a joke about DOGE being "a hustle." This offended fans greatly, to say the least. Then Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">tweeted</a> on Wednesday that Tesla would stop accepting BTC as payment for its vehicles due to environmental concerns, which pushed BTC lower.</p>

        <p>Anyone who's been around the crypto space for more than 20 minutes knows it's volatile, so a pullback in prices is no big deal and, frankly, probably temporary. But for such a selloff to happen <em>in this particular way</em>, at the whim of just one uber-rich guy, is a really bad look for the industry.</p>

        <p>A big part of crypto's promise is its potential to democratize finance for everyone. This Musk-driven selloff was the exact opposite. It supports the impression that the crypto market is "thin" and easily manipulated. This just isn't how a Serious Asset Class™️ is supposed to work, period.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, the market will become less susceptible to such episodes as participation <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/104522/steve-cohen-point72-crypto-market">continues to broaden</a> over time. There have been so many announcements lately of planned investment by <a href="https://decrypt.co/70779/cowen-crypto-custody">Wall Street institutions</a> and new integrations of crypto into <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/moneygram-to-let-cryptocurrency-traders-cash-in-their-investments.html">existing financial platforms</a> that it's hard to imagine the trend reversing on a dime. But it seems we'll have to keep an eye out in the meantime while all that <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104297/swiss-banking-giant-ubs-exploring-crypto-report">new stuff</a> is actually being implemented.</p>

        <p>Some quick disclosures and disclaimers: I'm long BTC and wouldn't touch DOGE with a 100-foot pole. Nothing in this newsletter is intended as financial advice. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4w454Lape8">Please, please, please</a> do your own research before risking any money. Yadda yadda yadda.</p>

        <p>The week's other news:</p>



        <ul>

          <li><strong>Ether's valuation topped $500 billion.</strong> The world's second-largest token was a notable exception to the week's broader crypto selloff.

Separately, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/104676/vitalik-buterin-donates-more-than-60m-to-charity-after-selling-meme-tokens-including-shiba-inu">donated $60 million</a> to charity from sales of several meme coins.</li>

          <li><strong>Tether disclosed details about its reserves for the first time.</strong> Almost half the popular stablecoin's backing consists of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt">unspecified commercial paper</a>. Hmmmm...<a href=""></a></li>


          <li><strong>Coinbase announced its first quarterly earnings as a public company.</strong> The exchange posted first-quarter net income of $771 million, up <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbases-first-ever-q1-earnings-report-is-today-but-the-real-focus-is-on-the-q2-view">more than twentyfold</a> from a year ago. Yowza.</li>


          <li><strong>U.S. authorities are investigating Binance.</strong><a href=""></a> Both the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice are looking into possible illicit activity on the exchange, Bloomberg News <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in">reports</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>EBay opened to sales of non-fungible tokens.</strong> The e-commerce giant is the first mainstream tech platform to <a hre="digital collectibles like trading cards, images or video clips on its platform">enable NFT features</a> alongside its other offerings for users.</li>

          <li><strong>Diem is coming to the U.S.</strong> The Facebook-backed stablecoin, formerly known as Libra, said Wednesday it has withdrawn its application for a Swiss payment license and will instead <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/facebook-backed-diem-is-moving-from-switzerland-to-the-us.html">shift its operations</a> to the United States. The Diem token's planned implementation is shaping up very differently than the controversial initial idea for Libra, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIV2yYmN2CY">CNBC International</a>.</li>


          <li><strong>China's digital yuan is getting mixed reviews</strong> from early users, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-05-10/digital-yuan-fails-to-impress-early-users-video">Bloomberg News</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>On a happier note, China landed its first rover on Mars.</strong> The vehicle, dubbed Zhurong, <a href="https://www.space.com/china-mars-rover-landing-success-tianwen-1-zhurong">reached the Red Planet</a> on Friday.</li>
