**Happy New Year!** For anyone involved in web3, it's certainly a relief to see the annus horribilis that was 2022 come to an end.

I'm guardedly optimistic for 2023. Looking ahead, I really like this quote from a recent [CoinDesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2022/12/20/10-predictions-for-the-future-of-crypto-in-2023/) with some predictions for 2023. They also neatly captured here the *mood* of people in web3 going into the New Year, I think:

*“Read the room and assess the damage,” says Sandra Ro, CEO of the Global Blockchain Business Council... “Regroup with humility, rebuild with integrity, regain trust, rise again.”*

In the spirit of assessing the damage, here are 2022's year-end returns for major market benchmarks. I include here crypto and some major conventional assets as well:

- **ETH:** -67%
- **BTC:** -64%
- **Global Crypto Market Cap:** -64%
- **Nasdaq Composite:** -33%
- **S&P 500:** -19%
- **Gold:** +0.1%
- **Crude Oil:** +7%
- **U.S. Dollar Index:** +8%

Of course, the major catalyst to this dismal showing was the most aggressive increase in official interest rates around the world [in 20 years](https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-central-banks-deliver-historic-rate-hike-blast-2022-2022-12-23/). This in turn raised borrowing costs for consumers and investors, discouraging speculation in crypto, stocks, and other assets.

Hence a whole heap of selling.

For crypto investors, there are some glimmers of hope in 2023, though. Consider:

- **The tightening cycle may finally end.** The U.S. Federal Reserve recently [slowed the pace](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/federal-reserve-slows-interest-rate-hikes-with-05-increase/ar-AA15huuV) of its rate hikes slightly and may have to cease or even reverse course altogether at some point this year to [stave off recession](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/billionaire-investor-jeff-gundlach-says-115028996.html). The Fed famously has a [dual mandate](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100715/breaking-down-federal-reserves-dual-mandate.asp) in its charter -- to promote both price stability and full employment in the U.S. economy. It may have to shift focus to the latter half of that equation soon.  

- **Outside the U.S., the impetus to "de-dollarize" should be strong as ever.** The greenback's strength in 2022 due to Fed tightening wreaked a lot of [economic havoc overseas](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2022/10/27/how-a-strong-dollar-hurts-europe--emerging-markets/) as it disrupted flows of capital and goods priced in dollars around the world. If that whets some participants' appetite for alternatives to pricing everything in dollars, bitcoin in particular could benefit in 2023. To be sure, BTC has a long way still to go to become the standard for global trade, as its most ardent fans hope. But it also doesn't have to get all the way to that finish line to enjoy a big rally relative to its current price.

- **Users' appetite for alternatives to Death Star-sized tech and finance companies also seems fully intact.** Yes, crypto certainly took its lumps in 2022, both in terms of market performance and public perception. But know who else the public hates? [Big Tech](https://www.propublica.org/article/google-display-ads-piracy-porn-fraud?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) and [Wall Street](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/17/anti-corporate-sentiment-in-u-s-is-now-widespread-in-both-parties/). To the extent that a lot of web3 companies and services are aimed at replacing incumbents in those industries, there are still opportunities to be a "lesser evil" or even a "good guy" alternative for consumers. (That is, if the web3 products are high-quality and solve real problems for users. We don't get to skip those parts.)

As I've mentioned before, it was remarkable in 2022 to see how entrepreneurs continued to build new web3 products, and even some companies, right through the dark of "Crypto Winter." If you read this newsletter regularly, you probably noticed those sort of headlines each week in 2022, right alongside ones about bloodletting in token markets, corporate bankruptcies, and sometimes outright chicanery like we saw in [FTX's collapse](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crash-alameda-robinhood-bizarre-finance-schemes-2022-12).

The web3 space right now is a mix of all these things at once, the good, the bad, and the ugly. The biggest mistake in telling the story, I believe, is to oversimplify and characterize it as all one thing or the other.
