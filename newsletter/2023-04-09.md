**It's not unusual at this point** for star musicians to experiment with non-fungible tokens. But two recent announcements by rock royalty show starkly different approaches to marketing the tokens.

David Bowie's estate said it's preparing to offer a previously unreleased version of his hit Let's Dance [as an NFT](https://decrypt.co/125653/unreleased-david-bowie-recording-debut-music-nft), with proceeds going to charity.

Separately, the Rolling Stones said they will offer  vintage photos of the band, each offered in physical form paired with an NFT. But there's a catch: The Stones are pitching the the tokens as "[Digital Certificates of Authenticity](https://www.theblock.co/post/225338/rolling-stones-nfts-digital-certificates-of-authenticity)," or "DCOAs", eschewing the term "NFTs," which took on a lot of baggage as prices plunged during last year's Crypto Winter.

Who knows whether this will work to attract more bidders for the tokens. But it will be interesting to see if the tactic becomes a trend among other artists interested in on-chain technology.

**Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk's editor in chief,** just sounded a loud alarm about American crypto regulation.  

In [an editorial](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/30/coindesk-editorial-it-sure-looks-like-the-us-is-trying-to-kill-crypto/) published March 30, Reynolds addressed growing complaints in the crypto industry that several U.S. regulatory agencies are effectively coordinating to choke off *all* companies in the sector, regardless of involvement in any specific wrongdoing and without any sweeping legislative ban in place.

Reynolds stopped just short of endorsing this assertion. But he also noted it's "increasingly hard to argue against," considering recent anti-crypto provisions in the rescue plan for Silicon Valley Bank and other measures.

It's an explosive accusation -- and difficult to prove.

*But whether this is a coordinated effort against crypto or not may be irrelevant. Some people are convinced it’s real, and not just my friend Harry. The idea is rampant now: The U.S. has it in for crypto. So some firms are looking at moving overseas, while others are worried they will lose or be unable to obtain bank accounts. And it’s not just industry folk who believe this. Bankers, for instance, are declining invitations to speak at crypto gatherings, fearful of painting targets on their institutions’ backs.*

*Without a significant change of course by the Biden administration, the view that the U.S. is anti-crypto will soon become too entrenched to uproot. The fact that most of the U.S. government’s actions have been punitive rather than constructive is a huge factor.*
