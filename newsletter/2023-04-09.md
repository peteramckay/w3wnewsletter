**Many famous entertainers** have offered either their work or collectibles for fans as non-fungible tokens lately. But two recent announcements by rock n' roll royalty show starkly different approaches to marketing the tokens.

David Bowie's estate [announced Thursday](https://decrypt.co/125653/unreleased-david-bowie-recording-debut-music-nft) it will offer a previously unreleased version of his hit Let's Dance as an NFT, with proceeds going to charity. Separately, the Rolling Stones will soon [offer  vintage photos](https://www.theblock.co/post/225338/rolling-stones-nfts-digital-certificates-of-authenticity) of the band, each offered in physical form paired with an NFT.

But there's a catch: The Stones are pitching their tokens as "Digital Certificates of Authenticity," or "DCOAs," eschewing the term "NFT." From a technical standpoint, there's really no difference. But the Stones seem wary of the "NFT" label as it took on a lot of baggage when prices plunged during last year's Crypto Winter.

The Block notes that television and movie studios have [used similarly vague language](https://www.theblock.co/post/225338/rolling-stones-nfts-digital-certificates-of-authenticity) lately in issuing collectible tokens, calling them anything but "NFTs."

For the broader market, it will be interesting to see if this rhetorical jiujitsu "sticks" in the months ahead. Perhaps some new term beside "NFT" will take over as the dominant nomenclature for these kinds of tokens? Or perhaps Bowie's method -- frankly *calling the thing what it is* using a name that works perfectly well already -- can make a comeback?

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Bitcoin mining difficulty** and hash rate hit [fresh all-time highs](https://www.theblock.co/post/225359/bitcoin-difficulty-hashrate-miner-revenue). Mining revenue was also up, rising to $755 million in March, according to The Block.

- **Uniswap trading volume handily topped Coinbase's**  in March, $70 billion to $49.2 billion. The decentralized Uniswap was particularly active during a brief period when the USDC stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar. But Coinbase could be due to push back ahead now as token markets are functioning more normally, [according to CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/06/uniswap-topped-coinbases-trading-volume-in-march-during-usdc-depeg-us-crackdown/).

- **The U.S. Treasury Department** published its [first detailed analysis](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf) of the crime and national security risks associated with decentralized finance protocols. Common criminals, terrorists, and North Korea's authoritarian regime are all using defi to steal and launder money, [Treasury said](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/06/us-treasury-warns-that-defi-used-by-north-korea-scammers-to-launder-dirty-money/). But it also noted that old-fashioned fiat cash is still used [far more widely](https://decrypt.co/125623/crooks-defi-crypto-fiat-treasury) for illicit activity.

- **The total value of gold** tokenized on blockchain networks surpassed the $1 billion milestone on Wednesday. It has recently been boosted by the U.S. banking crisis, The Block [reports](https://www.theblock.co/post/224950/tokenized-gold-tops-1-billion-market-cap-amid-banking-crisis-concerns).

- **Repayments for users** of the failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox [have begun](https://www.theblock.co/post/225362/mtgox-repayment-window-open) under the supervision of a Tokyo court.

- **Prosecutors ordered** Terra Labs founder Do Kwon to [stop liquidating](https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-ordered-to-halt-crypto-liquidation/) millions of dollars in cryptoassets.

- **Polygon became** the second most popular blockchain for gaming in March, [behind only WAX](https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-2nd-largest-gaming-blockchain/).

- **Attendance plummeted** at Decentraland's second-ever Metaverse Fashion Week. The event saw 26,000 unique visitors, down 76% from last year's 108,000 visitors, Decrypt [reports](https://decrypt.co/125737/winner-decentraland-metaverse-fashion-week-2023).

- **Blogger Andy Baio** discovered that every modern version of macOS has been [hiding a copy](https://waxy.org/2023/04/the-bitcoin-whitepaper-is-hidden-in-every-modern-copy-of-macos/) of Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin whitepaper for years. Baio found it while fixing his printer. LOL.

- **Some people would say that's not an improvement.** As part of an emissions-reduction program, Cointelegraph reports that Irish dairy farmers are turning [cow dung into bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVOJAWP688).

**Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk's editor in chief,** just sounded a loud alarm about American crypto regulation.  

In [an editorial](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/03/30/coindesk-editorial-it-sure-looks-like-the-us-is-trying-to-kill-crypto/) published March 30, Reynolds addressed growing complaints in the crypto industry that several U.S. regulatory agencies are effectively coordinating to choke off *all* companies in the sector, regardless of involvement in any specific wrongdoing and without any sweeping legislative ban in place.

Reynolds stopped just short of endorsing this assertion. But he also noted it's "increasingly hard to argue against," considering recent anti-crypto provisions in the rescue plan for Silicon Valley Bank and other measures.

*But whether this is a coordinated effort against crypto or not may be irrelevant. Some people are convinced it’s real, and not just my friend Harry. The idea is rampant now: The U.S. has it in for crypto. So some firms are looking at moving overseas, while others are worried they will lose or be unable to obtain bank accounts. And it’s not just industry folk who believe this. Bankers, for instance, are declining invitations to speak at crypto gatherings, fearful of painting targets on their institutions’ backs.*

*Without a significant change of course by the Biden administration, the view that the U.S. is anti-crypto will soon become too entrenched to uproot. The fact that most of the U.S. government’s actions have been punitive rather than constructive is a huge factor.*
