**The New York Times** just ran one story explicitly about the crypto crash and one perhaps unintentionally so.

Reporter David Yaffe-Bellany checked in on the billionaire cohort of early token investors and found they're [weathering the bear market pretty well](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/technology/crypto-crash-divide.html), while many small retail investors and less senior startup employees have been wiped out.

One juicy factoid Yaffe-Bellany dug up:

<em><blockquote>The combined fortunes of the 16 richest crypto billionaires exceeded $135 billion in March, Forbes estimated. As of this week, the total was about $76 billion, but most of the loss was suffered by a single billionaire, Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of the crypto exchange Binance, whose $65 billion fortune shrank to $17.4 billion.</blockquote></em>

In other words, even seeing one's fortune shrink by tens of billions is no doubt painful, it's also true that CZ still has tens of billions left in his fortune. So he's not going to starve. To varying degrees, other early crypto "whales" are in a similar position, but that's not so much the case for average Joe or Jane.

The Times story also pays particular attention to the Winklevoss brothers, billionaire founders of Gemini Capital. Seems they started a tour of their cover band Mars Junction the same week they announced the crypto portfolio management firm would be laying off 10% of its staff.

Not a good look, bros.

Separately, the Times ran a really nice [guest essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/opinion/coping-climate-war-happiness.html) on Tuesday by clinical psychologist Mary Pipher about how she maintains calm and a routine to create good days despite news-related stressors. 

She doesn't mention the markets specifically -- hey, there are a lot of sources of big-picture gloom to choose from these days. But at any rate, Phipher definitely gives some [good advice](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/28/opinion/coping-climate-war-happiness.html) that I think a lot of us in crypto world could use right now.
