**The New York Times** just ran one story explicitly about the crypto crash and one more indirectly so.

Reporter David Yaffe-Bellany checked in on the billionaire cohort of early token investors and found they're [weathering the bear market pretty well](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/technology/crypto-crash-divide.html), while many small retail investors and less senior startup employees have been wiped out.

One juicy factoid Yaffe-Bellany dug up:

<em><blockquote>The combined fortunes of the 16 richest crypto billionaires exceeded $135 billion in March, Forbes estimated. As of this week, the total was about $76 billion, but most of the loss was suffered by a single billionaire, Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of the crypto exchange Binance, whose $65 billion fortune shrank to $17.4 billion.</blockquote></em>

Pure number crunching aside, the Times story is particularly unflattering to the Winklevoss brothers, founders of Gemini Capital. Seems they started a tour of their garage band TKTKTKTK the same week they announced the crypto portfolio management firm would be laying off 10% of its staff.

Not a good look, bros.

Separately, the Times ran a really nice column on TKTKTK by clinical psychologist TKTKTKTK about how she maintains calm and a routine to create good days despite news-related stressors. She doesn't mention the markets specifically -- hey, there are a lot of sources of big-picture gloom to choose from these days. But at any rate, TKTKTKTK definitely gives some good advice that I think a lot of us in crypto world could use right now.

The week's other notable headlines:

 CoinDesk reports that Genesis Trading is facing big losses related to the meltdown of Three Arrows Capital. <!-- Cryptocurrency market maker and lending firm Genesis Trading is facing potential losses into the “hundreds of millions,” according to three people familiar with the matter.
The losses at Genesis relate, in part, to exposure to over-leveraged hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance, and are on the order of “a few hundred million dollars,” one of the people said.
