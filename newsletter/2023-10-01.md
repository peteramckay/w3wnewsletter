# 4 lessons about regulation from FTX's collapse
## #Web3Weekly: Sept. 24-30, 2023

**To borrow a phrase from my favorite movie about Wall Street,** I suspect prosecutors' case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is ["a Grenada."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA2diI3zRso) But we'll soon know for certain, since his trial on federal fraud charges is scheduled to begin in New York [on Tuesday](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-trial-begins-tuesday-what-know-rcna117591).

Like it or not, the trial will also be a major event to shape public perception of the broader crypto industry. And it will do little to clarify the overall U.S. regulatory picture for crypto.

As many  in the industry have observed, U.S. investors and startup founders don't really need more case law regarding the token market right now. They need *new statutes* from Congress that are specific to this new type of asset.

Figuring out the details of what would go into such a bill is easier said than done, of course. But based on my experience both in web3 and in covering conventional markets for the Wall Street Journal, I've come to believe these four things would at least be a good starting point:

1. *Require companies to separate token custody and trading on customers' behalf.* This would make crypto exchanges work more like their Wall Street counterparts, in a good way. For instance, when you want to buy shares of General Motors at the New York Stock Exchange, you don't open a personal account at NYSE. You do that with a broker, who then trades at NYSE on your behalf. Regulations require the broker to take certain precautions in handling your money, and the NYSE concerns itself only with maintaining fair trading, execution, and pricing. Separating the roles eliminates FTX-like conflicts of interest and creates clearer accountability if something goes wrong.

2. *Individuals should not be prohibited from handling custody or trading amongst themselves.* This is the flipside of the first item, to make sure the system doesn't tip too much in the opposite direction, to the point of infringing on personal freedoms. Banning true peer-to-peer trades or self-custody, as some members of Congress have already [proposed](https://decrypt.co/117221/senator-warren-crypto-bill-kyc-self-custody-wallets), would undercut free-market values and the unique innovations of digital assets. You should still be able to do what you want with *your* tokens.

3. *Non-custodial crypto exchanges should push for a degree of self-regulatory authority.* Again, this would create parity with traditional trading venues like [NYSE](https://www.nyse.com/regulation), [Nasdaq](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/Show_Doc.aspx?File=market_regulation.html), and the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-regulation.html). I think this is somewhat misunderstood in the industry, as people tend to think solely of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission as a U.S. financial regulator. But the reality is more complex than that, with several layers *including the exchanges themselves,* vested with some degree of power over rule-setting, fining, and even banning members. If anything reaches an FTX-like level of fraud, yes, the SEC gets involved as the ultimate big kahuna. But Wall Street exchanges, by U.S. law, run a lot of day-to-day oversight functions entirely on their own, as self-contained reglatory authorities. Why couldn't Coinbase or its peers do the same, as long as they gave up holding customer money?  

4. *No matter what laws are passed, investors should still take extensive precautions to protect themselves.* I always find it odd that some people seem to want the SEC to regulate crypto like it regulates stocks and bonds. Or at least that's the frequent implication.  

God help us. You do realize there are gaping holes in how the commission oversees Wall Street, right?

One famous example: The SEC's decades-long, [Keystone Kops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Cops)-like "regulation" of Bernie Madoff's fraud in the stock market. He was fully under the commission's jurisdiction [the whole time](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-didnt-the-sec-catch-madoff-it-might-have-been-policy-not-to-86356/).

The only thing that truly exposed Madoff was the market meltdown of 2008-2009, which made his losses impossible to hide financially. The SEC only swooped to pick up the pieces.

So, yes, the importance of [DYOR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=do%20your%20own%20research) still very much stands for investors, in *any* market. I know it's a cliche, but for token buyers in particular, it bears repeating.
