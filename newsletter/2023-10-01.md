# 4 lessons about regulation from FTX's collapse
## #Web3Weekly: Sept. 24-30, 2023

<!-- Remember: Keep it to ~400 words! -->

**To borrow a phrase from my favorite movie about Wall Street,** my hunch is that prosecutors' case against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is ["a Grenada."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA2diI3zRso)

I say that in large part because of SBF's own [incessant yapping](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/01/sam-bankman-fried-trial-ftx/?itid=mr_technology_1) to the press since he was charged. Multiple legal analysts -- really, any lawyer who's had their license for more than 10 minutes -- have said this loquaciousness is highly inadvisable for a defendant in a federal criminal case. But hey...

We'll soon know for certain how much SBF has harmed himself, since his trial on federal fraud charges is scheduled to begin in New York [on Tuesday](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-trial-begins-tuesday-what-know-rcna117591).

Like it or not, the trial will also be a major event to shape public perception of the broader crypto industry. And it will do little to clarify the overall U.S. regulatory picture for crypto.

As many  in the industry have observed, U.S. investors and startup founders don't really need more case law regarding the token market right now. They need *new statutes* from Congress that are specific to this new type of asset, establish reasonable rules, and set processes for complying.

Of course, figuring out the details of what would go into such a bill is easier said than done. But from observing FTX's meltdown and other industry turbulence over the past year, I've come to believe these four things would at least be a good starting point. (A decade-plus covering conventional markets for the Wall Street Journal might also have influenced this list a little as well.):

1. *Requiring companies to separate token custody and trading on customers' behalf is a good idea.* This would make crypto exchanges work more like their Wall Street counterparts, in a good way. For instance, when you want to buy shares of General Motors at the New York Stock Exchange, you don't open a personal account at NYSE. You do that with a broker, who then trades at NYSE on your behalf. Regulations require the broker to take certain precautions in handling your money, and the NYSE concerns itself only with maintaining fair trading, execution, and pricing. Separating the roles eliminates FTX-like conflicts of interest and creates clearer accountability if something goes wrong.

2. *Individuals should not be prohibited from handling custody or trading themselves if they want.* This is the flipside of the first item, to make sure the system doesn't tip too much in the opposite direction. Banning true peer-to-peer trades or self-custody, as some members of Congress have already [proposed](https://decrypt.co/117221/senator-warren-crypto-bill-kyc-self-custody-wallets), would undercut basic free-market values and the unique innovations of digital assets. We need tokenized systems precisely because they enable true peer-to-peer transactions and self-custody. These are features, not bugs, and they have nothing to do with the Sam Bankman-Frieds of the world.

3. *Non-custodial crypto exchanges should push for a degree of self-regulatory authority.* Again, this creates parity with traditional trading venues like [NYSE](https://www.nyse.com/regulation), [Nasdaq](https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/Show_Doc.aspx?File=market_regulation.html), and the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-regulation.html). I think this is somewhat misunderstood, as people tend to think solely of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission as a U.S. financial regulator. But the reality is more complex than that, with several layers *including the exchanges themselves,* vested with some power over rule-setting, fining, and even banning members. If anything reaches an FTX-like level of fraud, yes, the SEC gets involved as the ultimate big kahuna. But Wall Street exchanges, by U.S. law, run a lot of day-to-day regulatory functions entirely on their own, as self-contained reglatory authorities. Why couldn't Coinbase or its peers do the same?  

4. *No matter what laws are passed, users should still take extensive precautions to protect themselves.* I always find it odd that some people seem to want the SEC to regulate crypto like it regulates stocks and bonds. Or at least that's the frequent implication.  

God help us. You do realize there are gaping holes in how the commission oversees Wall Street, right?

Just to cite one famous example: Bernie Madoff executed his fraud over decades while supposedly employing an S&P 500 arbitrage strategy. That's one of the most "vanilla" trading styles on Wall Street, using investment instruments fully under SEC oversight the whole time.

And yet the SEC missed it spectacularly. The only thing that truly exposed Madoff was the market plunge of 2008-2009, which made it impossible to hide his losses from a financial standpoint. By then, many of his customers had already lost their life savings, and no amount of prison time for him would recover those losses for the customers.

So, yes, the importance of DYOR still very much stands, in *any* market. I know it's a cliche, but for token buyers in particular, it bears repeating.

The crypto industry's current regulatory back-and-forth may end in any number of ways. But in no scenario should you ever assume the SEC will ultimately save you. Sounds harsh, I know. But that's the reality.
