"Linux of finance"

https://mail.blockworks.com/p/will-crypto-become-linux-finance

*The principles of decentralized crypto are likely to influence a blockchain-based financial system in the same way that the open-source Linux community has exerted outsized influence on the for-profit software industry â€” and the for-profit finance industry may make vital contributions to open-source crypto in the same way that the software industry does with Linux.*

*Crypto purists may see that as a partial victory, at best, but it might turn out to be a win-win outcome, as with the all-conquering software industry.*

*The internet as we know it would not exist without open-source Linux and open-source blockchains may become its financial equivalent: A decentralized core that enables a much larger for-profit, centralized ecosystem.*
