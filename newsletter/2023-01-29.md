*"800 Pounds of Connectivity" by Peter A. McKay × DALL·E*

**Tech's 800-pound gorillas** have seen mostly dismal headlines lately:

- **Google** is [laying off staff](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/21/google-employees-scramble-for-answers-after-layoffs-hit-long-tenured.html) and [fending off a new antitrust suit](https://www.cnet.com/tech/feds-vs-google-what-dojs-antitrust-lawsuit-means-for-online-ads/) from U.S. regulators over its practices in the ad market.

- **Meta** is facing formidable new competition from Apple, which now plans to [launch a headset](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/apples-arvr-headset-what-to-expect-in-2023/ar-BB14pstE) for metaverse apps. Of course, this might also be read as a problem *for Apple,* considering [how disastrously](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/10/what-name-meta-platforms-stock-down-since-change/) the "pivot" to a metaverse strategy has gone so far for the company formerly known as Facebook. Maybe Apple really has  figured out something Meta hasn't about this product category. Or maybe, to borrow an expression, it's just a dog that won't hunt.

- **An anti-hate speech group** filed a [lawsuit against Twitter](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/elon-musk-twitter-antisemitic-hate-speech-lawsuit-germany) in Germany for lax policing of antisemitic content, including holocaust denial.

- **Microsoft was a rare bright spot** for the week, announcing [decent earnings](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/microsoft-earnings-beat-expectations-cloud-growth-continues-to-slow/ar-AA16Hsp0) and a [$10 billion investment](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html) in OpenAI. But it has also [announced layoffs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/23/what-microsofts-recent-layoffs-mean-for-the-company-and-investors/) recently and suffered during the longer-term tech selloff, down 20% over the last 12 months.

- **Earlier this month, Amazon announced** plans to [lay off 18,000 workers](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-to-lay-off-more-than-17-000-workers-more-that-originally-expected-11672875239?mod=hp_minor_pos27).

- **Big Tech has been leading the broader bear market in stocks.** The Nasdaq 100 Index, which tracks the largest listed tech companies in the U.S., is down 19% over the past 12 months, compared to a 10% decline in the S&P 500.  

**Why this matters:** If you're keen for decentralized tech to become a mass phenomenon, the developments above represent big opportunities. Frankly, Big Tech dominates the average user's daily experience of the internet and computing in general right now. But if such companies are being cut down to size, either by market forces or regulators or both, that could create much-needed openings for other platforms and companies to break through.

People aren't going to stop using the internet, after all. And some of these laid off workers will do startups of their own. So there is hope yet.

The week's other notable headlines:

- **Bitcoin is on track** for its best January since 2013, up about 40% so far, according to [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/27/bitcoins-best-start-since-2020-led-by-bullish-us-trading-hours/).
