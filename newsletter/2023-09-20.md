# #Web3Weekly: Sept. 3-9, 2023

**The week's headlines** were a little more startup-y than usual, it seems. But don't fear. We'll get back to technical updates about protocols and other such nerdery later whenever it becomes necessary. ðŸ˜Š

The latest:

- **Ripple acquired Fortress Trust,** which specializes in helping enterprises interact with digital currencies. [CNBC reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/09/08/ripple-acquires-crypto-focused-chartered-trust-company-fortress-trust/) that the deal could move Ripple beyond its current focus on digital payments. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission [filed a new appeal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/sec-counters-ripple-in-effort-to-appeal-groundbreaking-xrp-ruling/ar-AA1gs5hr) in its ongoing regulatory dispute with Ripple, issuer of the world's [fifth-largest cryptocurrency](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) by market capitalization.

- **Visa announced a new pilot program** in which it will use the Solana chain to settle merchant transactions in USDC. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/05/visa-stablecoin-usdc-solana-worldpay-nuvei-merchants-payments/))

- **A federal judged ruled in favor of Uniswap,** saying it shouldn't be liable under existing securities law for scams run by third parties on its platform. The decision could prove to be an important precedent for other exchanges facing increased scrutiny, including Coinbase. ([Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/securities-law/new-york-judge-previews-crypto-thinking-in-uniswaps-huge-win))

- **The Consensys-owned infrastructure platform Infura** plans to start decentralizing by year-end. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/249991/consensys-owned-infura-plans-to-start-decentralizing-by-end-of-2023))

- **Nearly half the financial institutions** recently [surveyed](https://www.greenwich.com/market-structure-technology/digital-assets-managers-fuel-data-infrastructure-needs) by analytics firm Coalition Greenwich in the U.S., United Kingdom, and continental Europe held digital assets on behalf of clients.

- **Former FTX executive Ryan Salame** pleaded guilty to federal charges in connection with the exchange's meltdown in late 2022. He could forfeit up to $1.5 billion in assets as part of his plea agreement. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/07/ex-ftx-executive-ryan-salame-pleads-guilty-to-us-criminal-charges/))

- **El Salvador marked the second anniversary** of recognizing bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The experiment's results so far have been mixed, with USD still far more prevalent in day-to-day usage among citizens, the newspaper El Pais [reports](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/two-years-of-bitcoin-in-bukele-s-el-salvador-an-opaque-experiment-with-a-little-used-currency/ar-AA1g8ffH).

- **Binance** is ending support for non-fungible tokens on the Polygon chain. (The Block) https://www.theblock.co/post/249937/binance-to-remove-support-for-polygon-nfts

- **Some crypto miners in Texas** are bolstering their profits by selling power back to the state to alleviate demand on its strained power grid. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/155460/how-bitcoin-miners-in-texas-are-making-millions-without-mining-at-all))

- **A Turkish court** handed out an 11,196-year sentence to a defendant in a crypto enforcement case. Wow. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/09/08/11196-years-in-prison-for-faruk-ozer-ceo-of-collapsed-turkish-crypto-exchange-thodex/))

- **Note-taking apps don't make us smarter,** according to the Verge's Casey Newton. Yes, they capture raw information. But digesting and synthesizing it to glean truly valuable insight is still very much on us as users, he says. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/25/23845590/note-taking-apps-ai-chat-distractions-notion-roam-mem-obsidian))

- **Only in Australia:** U.K.-based bitcoiner Peter McCormack just did [his latest podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggY-covPBR0) from Sydney, which he's visiting for a conference. This entailed a cheeky upside-down camera shot to begin the show, followed by a harrowing anecdote during the opening banter about his guest (money manager Peter Dunworth) nearly being eaten by a shark. The boys also eventually got around to talking bitcoin, of course.
