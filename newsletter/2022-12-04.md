# Founder tells his side of the FTX debacle
## #Web3Weekly: Nov. 27 to Dec. 3, 2022

**Legendary Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee** once said there is a large category of stories that are "interesting if true." In other words, narratives some concerned party is peddling that require further independent verification.

The crypto world saw a doozie of such a story last week: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried granted several media interviews in which he portrayed the exchange's implosion as unintended tragedy, not purposeful fraud. His most extensive remarks were during an hour-long [live interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyoGdwVIwWw) with the New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin at a conference sponsored by the newspaper, including some laudably [tough questioning](https://www.mediaite.com/opinion/andrew-ross-sorkins-interview-of-disgraced-sam-bankman-fried-was-journalism-masterclass/) by Sorkin.

Needless to say, [not everyone](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crypto-billionaire-mike-novogratz-says-sam-bankman-fried-should-go-to-jail-as-the-ex-ftx-billionaire-worries-about-paying-his-lawyers/ar-AA14PTls) is buying Bankman-Fried's benign characterization of events [quite yet](https://money.yahoo.com/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-says-231208022.html). But it is nevertheless interesting (strictly by Bradlee's definition) to hear him go on the record with it, especially as he says he's going public [against his lawyers' advice](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/what-legal-strategy-sam-bankman-fried-s-ftx-comments-will-cause-headaches-experts-say/ar-AA14HvKC).

I definitely believe that last part, at least!
