**Scary as the new U.S. banking crisis has been,** it has produced one notable winner so far:

Bitcoin.

The token's price rose 19% <!-- Update number Friday --> for the week, even as several more conventional banks [floundered]()<!-- Need link -->. Bitcoin's gains thus handily beat the S&P 500, which fell TK% for the week, driven by a TK% drop in its financial sector.

The drumbeat of news about troubled banks now seems likely to go on awhile longer, whether or not the worst-case scenario of a new crisis akin to 2008 materializes. Satoshi Nakamoto famously documented his idea for bitcoin in the midst of that crisis, envisioning it as a new monetary system that would avert such debacles in the future. <!-- Add links -->

It has frankly had a mixed record in that regard since, notably failing as an inflation hedge in 2022 as fears of that problem spread. The banking scare of 2023, however, is perhaps providing a measure of redemption. <!-- Add links -->

Clearly, bitcoin is benefiting right now from increased speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon move to an easier interest-rate policy, which would favor bets on riskier assets like stocks and crypto. Some true believers are also probably betting that we're moving closer to their long hoped-for day when the Bitcoin network may supplant conventional banking altogether.  <!-- Add links -->
