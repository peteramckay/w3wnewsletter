# Web3's stark developer shortage
## #Web3Weekly: Sept. 10-16, 2023

**Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire** mentioned a statistic on [Laura Shin's podcast](https://unchainedcrypto.com/jeremy-allaire-on-circles-multi-decade-strategy-and-where-stablecoin-regulation-is-headed/) Tuesday that grabbed my attention.

Around the episode's 19-minute mark, Allaire estimates *about 0.5% of the world's software developers are able to build web3 projects*. He views this as a big opportunity for Circle to build tools that enable web2 developers to apply their existing skills in on-chain environments.

Frankly, I'm not necessarily sure the right entity to pull off that feat is Circle, which is chiefly known at present for issuing the [USDC stablecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/). If they can, more power to them.

But even if not, *someone* needs to fix that very real developer problem Allaire laid out so cogently. It's really the only way we can move blockchain technology from serving largely as a platform for financial speculation into real products and applications that solve problems for users.
