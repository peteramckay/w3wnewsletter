**I recently came across** a handy, blessedly short definition of web3 and how it's different:

- *Web1 = Read*
- *Web2 = Read + Write*
- *Web3 = Read + Write + Own*

Credit and thanks for this go to the Web3 Gallery in New York, which includes the little summary above on [their website](https://www.web3gallery.com/).

If you crave more detail on the long-term evolution of the web since its birth in 1989, here's [an explainer](https://peteramckay.medium.com/a-brief-release-history-of-the-web-aeef5bb3b814) I wrote myself a little while back. But if you just need a basic [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR) version, the gallery totally nailed it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

On to the week's notable headlines:

- **The bloodbath among crypto asset managers continues:** Genesis [filed](https://w3w.news/content/genesis-c11.pdf) for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing [$3.4 billion owed](https://www.barrons.com/articles/genesis-bankruptcy-crypto-bitcoin-51674206942?refsec=markets) to its top 50 creditors. And Silvergate said it [swung to a $1 billion loss](https://www.theblock.co/post/202744/silvergate-bank-loss) in the fourth quarter, compared to a slight profit in the year-ago period.

- **U.S. authorities arrested** the founder of Bizlato, alleging the exchange [laundered more than $700 million](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-treasury-dept-says-has-identified-bitzlato-ltd-money-laundering-concern-2023-01-18/) in illicit funds.

- **Bitcoin mining** is expected to get about [10% harder](https://www.theblock.co/post/201203/the-storm-has-passed-but-bitcoin-mining-difficulty-is-about-to-blow-through-the-roof) due to a network update today.

- **Developer activity on web3 projects rose in 2022 despite the market plunge.** According to a [new report](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/web3-developer-report-q4-2022) by the dev platform Alchemy, work on crypto projects rose 493% in 2022's fourth quarter, helped by a 293% increase in deployment of smart contracts on the Ethereum network compared to a year ago. Separately, the venture firm Electric Capital published [research](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report) showing there were 23,000 monthly active developers working on crypto projects in December, up 5% from a year ago.

- **GitHub released** its annual ranking of [most popular programming languages](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages), based on code committed to repositories on its network. For the the third straight year, the top five were unchanged: JavaScript, Python, Java, Typescript, and C#. Meanwhile, C++ surpassed PHP to take sixth place.

- **Crypto has an urgent influencer marketing problem** akin to the one behind the [ill-fated Fyre Festival](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/01/17/crypto-marketing-needs-to-change-lets-make-2023-the-year-for-influencer-accountability/), says Oxygen CEO Nemo Yang.

- **The Polygon network** completed a hard fork designed to [stabilize transaction fees](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/17/polygon-completes-hard-fork-to-reduce-gas-fee-spikes-disruptive-reorgs/).

- **In a New York Times op-ed,** financier and former Obama adviser Steven Rattner described an emerging race among nations to [secure access to computer chips](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/opinion/america-biden-semiconductor-tsmc.html) as a vital economic resource, akin to previous wrangling to ensure access to oil supplies.

- **CoinDesk reports** that 196 U.S. lawmakers, or more than one-third of the current Congress, [received political donations](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/17/congress-ftx-problem-1-in-3-members-got-cash-from-crypto-exchanges-bosses/) from FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried prior to his company's meltdown in November. üò≤

- **Crypto was again a hot topic** at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. A consortium of organizations, including the Solana Foundation and Ripple, [announced a new partnership](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/17/solana-foundation-ripple-gbbc-and-others-form-partnership-to-promote-crypto-solutions-for-climate-change/) to promote crypto-based climate solutions. Meanwhile, CNBC reports that many of the Davos conference's powerful participants were keen to [shift the public narrative](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/davos-crypto-crowd-distance-themselves-from-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-its-fraud/ar-AA16vElp) about the crypto industry away from FTX's meltdown. In an interview with [Bloomberg TV](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-01-19/circle-ceo-on-future-of-crypto-regulation-video), Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said of FTX: "The technology didn't commit fraud. The technology didn't commit poor risk management or leverage decisions. Firms and people did that." *(Full disclosure: I've previously freelanced for WEF.)*

- **BREAKING:** The New York Times just realized there are still people [building web3 products and communities](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/17/business/crypto-market-meltdown-nft-blockchain.html) despite big declines in token prices in 2022. Who knew!

- **"Every flight between Boston and New York is a policy failure."** -- [@mcplanner](https://twitter.com/mcplanner/status/1613173892021121024)

- **An editorial cartoon** published in the New York World in 1923 [depicted a "cartoon dynamo" device](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/a-cartoonist-predicted-2023s-ai-drawing-machines-in-1923/) that would generate ideas and drawings for an artist, saving him a lot of labor. This sounds familiar...
