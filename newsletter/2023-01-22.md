**I recently came across** a handy, ultra-short definition of web3 and how it's different:

- *Web1 = Read*
- *Web2 = Read + Write*
- *Web3 = Read + Write + Own*

Credit and thanks for this go to the Web3 Gallery in New York, which includes the little summary above on [their website](https://www.web3gallery.com/).

If you crave more detail on the evolution of the web since its birth in 1989, here's [an explainer](https://peteramckay.medium.com/a-brief-release-history-of-the-web-aeef5bb3b814) I wrote myself a little while back. But if you just need a basic [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR) version, the gallery totally nailed it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

On to the week's notable headlines:

- **U.S. authorities arrested** the founder of Bizlato, alleging the exchange [laundered more than $700 million](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-treasury-dept-says-has-identified-bitzlato-ltd-money-laundering-concern-2023-01-18/) in illicit funds.

In an interview with [Bloomberg TV](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-01-19/circle-ceo-on-future-of-crypto-regulation-video), Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said of FTX: "The technology didn't commit fraud.
