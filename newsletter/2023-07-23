# A crypto gem from Mezrich
## #Web3Weekly: July 16-22, 2023

**Hands down, my favorite book** about crypto (so far) is journalist Ben Mezrich's [Bitcoin Billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=bitcoin+billionaires&ref=nb_sb_noss_1). Hence it's definitely worth a mention as part of my effort to highlight useful info about web3 basics for you this summer.

The book is ostensibly about twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss becoming early bitcoin investors -- and thus the titular billionaires. But Bitcoin Billionaires also doubles nicely as an accessible overview of the early history of crypto in general. Plus it's just flat-out a lot of fun, with wacky characters and fly-on-the-wall anecdotes throughout.

Mezrich had previously written about "the Winklevii" in his book [The Accidental Billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/The-Accidental-Billionaires-audiobook/dp/B002HIT0J0/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=mezrich&sr=8-10), which covered the founding of Facebook and was adapted for film as [The Social Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network). Cameron and Tyler were basically cast as the villains of that story, but their second act as bitcoin [whales](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/what-hodl-whale-and-other-cryptocurrency-slang-terms-mean.html) is probably still not as well-known to the general public even today.

For a quick taste of what Bitcoin Billionaires holds, check out [this TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN96Dgih3gI) by Mezrich about how he came to write the book.

But, really, go get yourself a copy of the full work. I promise you won't be disappointed.
