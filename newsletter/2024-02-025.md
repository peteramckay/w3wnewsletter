Lede item. Riff on t-plus innovation in TV...

If you take a snapshot in time, TV looks like it's doing relatively better than print. But if you look at them at comparable distances in time from that point at which each started to be disrupted by the internet, they look remarkably similar.

# Week in Review

<!-- Prompt: Leo, please summarize the news article in this browser tab. I'm looking for a paragraph of 2-3 conversational sentences, suitable to use in a newsletter I'm working on. -->

- Many tech workers at a coworking space focused on Solana blockchain development have purchased Apple's expensive new VR headset, the Vision Pro. Over 20 people at the mtnDAO event in Salt Lake City now own the headset, which costs around $5,000. They spend their days immersed in virtual workspaces, likely fueled by recent crypto wealth from projects like Solana and airdrops of new tokens. https://www.coindesk.com/culture/2023/02/15/apple-vision-pros-are-practically-dress-code-at-this-crypto-hacker-house

- 2024 is set to be a transformative year for technology, with AI, blockchain, and virtual reality converging to create a revolutionary digital landscape. AI is enabling thought-based creation in the metaverse, while blockchain is making asset ownership seamless and invisible. Virtual reality is on the brink of a breakthrough, poised to radically change our sensory experiences in digital spaces. At the heart of this convergence is Generation Z, who are not just using these technologies, but actively shaping them. Their engagement is creating a new economic and cultural landscape where imagination is the primary currency, and the limits of the digital world are defined only by our creativity. This exciting journey promises unprecedented avenues for innovation and interaction. https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/22/the-unified-future-of-ai-blockchain-and-virtual-worlds-in-2024/

- 2023 was a year of growth for the crypto industry, with Bitcoin's price skyrocketing and total market capitalization reaching $1.8 trillion. As the industry moves forward from past controversies, companies like Chainalysis, Fireblocks, and Gauntlet are leading the way in regulatory compliance, security, and optimization of economic models. Chainalysis, now with 300 public sector customers, uses on-chain data to trace crypto transactions and identify illegal activity. Fireblocks, with $1 billion in funding, helps investors and institutions hold cryptocurrencies securely and tokenizes traditional finance assets. Gauntlet, valued at $1 billion, assists decentralized finance exchanges in managing risk and optimizing profitability. These companies are helping the industry build sustainable growth and navigate regulatory scrutiny.
