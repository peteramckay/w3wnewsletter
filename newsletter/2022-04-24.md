**I'm glad to say** readers now have a much better way to comment and discuss this newsletter thanks to our recent [migration to Blogchain](https://blogchain.app/p/this-is-the-way-at-last/k6D3xFCqFD) for primary distribution.

Honestly, this historically wasn't a strength for #Web3Weekly. An email subscriber would sometimes respond to me directly after reading something of particular interest, sure. But there wasn't much interactivity beyond that.

That's now changed thanks to Blogchain's well-designed comment features, which offer a great way to continue the conversation after each week's edition comes out.

If you would like an invite to create a Blogchain account, just drop me an email at peter[at]capsule.social. I'll get an access code out to you soonest.

Let's get to the latest headlines:

### Blogchain Highlights

- **Capsule Social** added a new [content policy and roadmap](https://blogchain.app/contentpolicy) to the platform. This was one of the priorities during our recent Amsterdam work session.
