# It's the network, stupid.
## We've been getting helpful reminders lately why open protocols usually beat corporate control.

**Venture investor Chris Dixon** gets many things right in his recent book, a purposefully layman-friendly intro to web3 titled [Read Write Own](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chris+dixon+read+write+own&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_12). But two ideas in particular stood out to me:

1. **He repeatedly puts blockchain tech in context** of the internet's longer history and the services currently used by millions of consumers.  

2. **He distinguishes** protocol networks from corporate-run ones in stark, yet accessible, detail.

Public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin are protocol networks, as were technologies like the web, email, and Real Simple Syndication (RSS) before them. The benefit of protocol technologies is that they're open source, anyone can participate, and they can only be changed by community agreement, not the whim of a small team or even just a single executive.

Corporate-run networks tend to lack most or all of these characteristics. Think of any of the social apps owned by Meta, for example.

Building a sustainable business atop such a network can be difficult in the long run because the corporate overlord can make changes to the network at any time that upend your operation. Dixon also points out that corporate operators over time tend to increase their "take rates," or fees charged to smaller players for using the network, sometimes to prohibitive levels.

Mike Belshe, co-founder and CEO of crypto custodian BitGo, says the token market's structure is still ["too fragile"](https://www.theblock.co/post/284009/etf-custody-bitgo) and should be prioritized by companies, users, and regulators. Meanwhile, Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs head of digital assets, is [bullish](https://blockworks.co/news/goldman-sachs-future-public-blockchains) on the future of public blockchains.

- **No cheese for you!** France's National Center for Scientific Research announced that a decline in microbial diversity could eventually lead to the "extinction" of brie, Camembert, and various varieties of blue cheese. *Quelle horreur!* ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/03/15/sacr-bleu-cheese-enthusiasts-are-mourning-the-possible-extinction-of-brie-cheese/))
