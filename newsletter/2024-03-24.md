This move has complicated Ethereum's regulatory status, as the SEC considers the majority of other cryptocurrencies as securities. The SEC's stance on Ethereum has changed under Chair Gary Gensler, who has signaled that crypto assets produced by blockchains using a proof-of-stake model could be classified as securities.

The SEC has not yet approved Ethereum ETF applications, and the recent investigation could impact the CFTC's supervision of Ether futures markets. https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/
