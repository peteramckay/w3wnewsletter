Transition to Apple and Ethereum news...

**Fortune reports** that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been [questioning companies](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/) building on Ethereum, with an eye toward possibly classifying the network's native ether token as a security under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933.

Trasition out with allusion to product networks.

### Week in Review: March 17-23, 2024

- **Wall Street giant BlackRock** announced it will [launch a new fund](https://decrypt.co/222694/blackrock-ethereum-fund-buidl), dubbed BUIDL, for tokenized [real-world assets](https://decrypt.co/222694/blackrock-ethereum-fund-buidl). The new offering will be built on the Ethereum network -- a first for BlackRock.

- **Crypto prices pared their recent losses** after the Federal Reserve's policy committee [said Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/bitcoin-btc-price-falls-as-cryptocurrencies-lose-400-billion-value.html) it still plans several interest-rate cuts in the U.S. this year. Nevertheless, the market ended the week in the red, with bitcoin posting a 7-day decline of 3% and ether off 6% as of late Saturday in New York.

- **Bankers are preparing** to sell bankrupt FTX's minority stake in the AI startup Anthropic, now worth $1 billion. Proceeds will go toward repaying FTX's creditors. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/22/bankers-are-lining-up-buyers-for-ftxs-8-stake-in-ai-startup-anthropic-report/))

- **They said it:** Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the platform's usage by layer-2 networks has been ["interestingly low"](https://decrypt.co/222767/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-surprised-l2-usage-dencun) since Ethereum's recent Dencun upgrade. Mike Belshe, co-founder and CEO of crypto custodian BitGo, says the token market's structure is still ["too fragile"](https://www.theblock.co/post/284009/etf-custody-bitgo) and should be prioritized by companies, users, and regulators. Meanwhile, Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs head of digital assets, is [bullish](https://blockworks.co/news/goldman-sachs-future-public-blockchains) on the future of public blockchains.

- **New partnerships are forming in web3 gaming.** Immutable, Polygon Labs, and King River Capital announced plans to [launch a new $100 million fund](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2024/03/19/immutable-king-river-capital-polygon-labs-set-up-100m-web3-gaming-fund/) to invest in on-chain games. Meanwhile, Horizon Blockchain Games is partnering with Google Cloud to [simplify web3 game development](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sequence-partners-google-cloud-simplify-web3-nft-gaming-development) by making new tools available on Google's popular hosting platform.

- **The decentralized Fluence Cloudless Platform went live,** with the intention of competing with traditional infrastructure providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/protocol-village/))

- **Unfortunately, the week saw some notable product shutdowns as well.** Starbucks is set [to end](https://mashable.com/article/starbucks-sunsets-nft-reward-program-odyssey) its Odyssey rewards program, a beta project that uses non-fungible tokens. And the crypto exchange OKX told users it will [wind down operations in India](https://www.theblock.co/post/284003/crypto-exchange-okx-exiting-india) by April 30 due to new regulatory restrictions there.

### Odds & Ends

- **The average price of an electric car** is down in the U.S., almost to parity with combustion vehicles. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/18/electric-vehicle-price-drop/))

- **Would Einstein go into academia today?** Avi Loeb, former chair of Harvard's astronomy department, has his doubts. ([Medium](https://avi-loeb.medium.com/would-albert-einstein-end-up-in-academia-in-2024-5d7bf37a3e31))

- **No cheese for you!** France's National Center for Scientific Research announced that a decline in microbial diversity could eventually lead to the "extinction" of brie, Camembert, and various varieties of blue cheese. *Quelle horreur!* ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2024/03/15/sacr-bleu-cheese-enthusiasts-are-mourning-the-possible-extinction-of-brie-cheese/))
