**Wow, what a week.** Token markets went on a roller-coaster ride, and FTX [went bankrupt](https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-sbf-binance.html), a nasty surprise that renewed the debate over centralized exchanges' role in crypto. <!-- Need links -->

There was a also a big election in the U.S., which may have deep implications for the industry the next few years. (We call these "midterm elections" in America, because they fall in the middle of the president's four-year term.) I want to focus on that for now, as I have a promise to keep related to it.

Specifically, I made a [round of predictions](https://mailchi.mp/e75eddb5bf21/30n88eh8sm) after our last national election here, in November 2020, when Joe Biden was elected president. I purposely limited the scope of those predictions to the following two years, precisely because the midterms can greatly affect the course of a presidency if they produce s a new congressional majority. And I promised to check back after the 2022 midterms to see how my 2020 predictions fared.

So let's get to it. Note, I'm including just the headline version of each 2020 prediction here and an assessment of how it went, for the sake of brevity here. If you want the fuller commentary explaining each 2020 prediction, please check the [original article from 2020](https://mailchi.mp/e75eddb5bf21/30n88eh8sm).

Further on, I'll make new predictions through the *next* national election in 2024. But first let's run through the old ones, as promised:

- **There will be no new laws clarifying federal crypto regulation.** *Mostly wrong.* My main mistake with this one was phrasing it way too broadly. In fact, the crypto industry did get *some* notable new rules, crammed into the infrastructure bill that won passange and ostensibly was about roads, bridges, rural internet access, and solar panels. In particular, the crypto parts of the bill increased reporting requirements for centralized exchanges. <!-- TKTKTK description -->
However, there was no broad crypto-specific bill providing a comprehensive framework for the industry covering a wider array of issues. <!-- Package at ~2:00 in recent Bloomberg crypto show summarize lack of progress on crypto regulation nicely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CxARZyIYFA -->

- **Tech giants' algorithmic filter bubbles will continue to undermine democracy as we know it.** *Correct.* Do I even need to elaborate on this one? Let's move on...

- **Ethereum 2.0 will be a hit.** *Correct.*

- **The era of a weaker, more digital dollar will take hold.** *Partial credit.*

- **Our cities, including the tech and finance hubs, will lead America's eventual economic recovery from COVID19.** *Inconclusive.*

-->

On to some new predictions:

- There will be no new omnibus federal framework for crypto regulation that gives the industry clarity.
- Fed tightening will end, paving the way for a rally in risk assets.
- Bitcoin dominance will continue to erode.
- Global crypto market cap will grow faster than the S&P 500.
- Biden will run for re-election.
