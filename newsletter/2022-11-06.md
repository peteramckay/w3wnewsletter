**I'll confess I'm not yet a big fan of the metaverse** -- a small-m term referring broadly to a group of emerging technologies. But I like capital-m Meta -- the company formerly known as Facebook -- [even less](https://peteramckay.medium.com/whatever-they-call-it-facebook-will-still-suck-b167e64d8ec).

Frankly, I need to work on disentangling these two ideas more, if only to be fair to the small-m metaverse. I realized this while watching vlogger Marques Brownlee's [excellent recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqkhjL3WvWQ) on the topic.

He neatly covers the basics of metaverse technology, including the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) as the two building blocks the small-m "metaverse." Plus he gets a demo of capital-m Meta's gadgets from Mark Zuckerberg himself and gives a few thoughts of his own about how all this is shaping up.

Among Brownlee's important insights is this: *No matter what you think of metaverse technology, it's a whole separate question whether we should want just one company to own everyone's experience of it.*

I agree, it's obvious that (1) such an outcome would be awful. And (2) it's worth discussing this problem now, before an anticompetitive situation gets out of hand, as it has with search, digital ads, social, and other tech products.

Honestly, my own hunch is that AR and VR certainly are useful for gaming, as well as specialized training for certain dangerous jobs like flying an airplane or performing surgery. But when people start making broad statements like: "We're all going to live in the metaverse!"... Yeah... Umm... I just don't see a path to that yet.

But maybe I'm wrong.

I would also say it's by no means certain that capital-m Meta will "win" this new cateogry, however it shapes up. The company has been [hemorrhaging money](https://decrypt.co/112952/metas-metaverse-division-reports-3-67-billion-quarterly-loss) on it, and Wall Street has hammered Meta stock as a result, leaving the price down 73% this year. One hedge fund manager even just published an [open letter](https://medium.com/@alt.cap/time-to-get-fit-an-open-letter-from-altimeter-to-mark-zuckerberg-and-the-meta-board-of-392d94e80a18) to Zuckerberg urging him to invest less of shareholders' money in AR and VR.

That all becomes even more worrisome when you also consider:

- **Delivering AR and VR services requires specialized new hardware.** The history of big Silicon Valley companies doing both software and hardware well, or transitioning from one to the other, is mixed. [Google Glass](https://www.slashgear.com/1057796/the-fascinating-true-story-behind-the-failure-of-google-glass/), anyone?
- **Facebook/Meta in particular has arguably been trying to leap from services to hardware for EIGHT YEARS already,** since it bought [VR headset maker Oculus](https://about.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/) for $2 billion. I think they would prefer we all forget the timing of this little milestone and just start the clock on their metaverse efforts with the parent company Facebook's [re-branded as Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) in 2021. But, no, the timeline has really been running for them in the small-m metaverse category for much longer, since the Oculus acquisition back in 2014. So why exactly haven't they *already* succeded at it?  
- **Potential competition.** Amazingly, after Meta's stock-market drubbing this year, Apple's valuation ([$2.2 trillion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL)) is now almost *ten times* the size of Meta's ([$241 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META/key-statistics?p=META)), with a longer track record of building high-end hardware and intuitive user experiences.

Of course, Apple hasn't made any splashy announcements about metaverse products. In fact, its executives [hate the very word](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/apple-executive-slams-metaverse-word-204037500.html). But who cares? They've never said they hate AR and VR, which is what this stuff *really* is.

You can almost hear the [theme to Jaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX3bN5YeiQs) playing in your head if you think about what they could [very plausibly do](https://decrypt.co/112030/apple-metaverse-everything-we-know-so-far) with those technologies, no?
