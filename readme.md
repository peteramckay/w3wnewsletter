This repo includes all the copy for w3w, a newsletter about emerging technologies and trends re-shaping the web. It's published every Sunday. To subscribe, visit https://w3wnews.substack.com

I started the newsletter as a personal project in 2017. In its early iterations, it was sometimes published on an occasional basis, under a few different titles.

That said, w3w has had one thematic throughline that's been consistent from the beginning: a focus on how we can use new tools to build a web that truly works for everyone.
