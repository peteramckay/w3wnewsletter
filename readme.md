This repository includes all the copy for the newsletter <strong>#Web3 Weekly</strong>, which covers all things decentralization. Older issues are saved as HTML, and newer ones as markdown.

The newsletter started as a personal project in 2017 and in its early iteration was sometimes published on an occasional basis, under slightly different titles. Since fall 2019, it has run continuously as <strong>#Web3 Weekly</strong>.

The newsletter is published every Sunday. To subscribe, visit https://w3w.news
