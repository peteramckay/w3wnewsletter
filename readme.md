This repository includes all the copy for the newsletter <strong>#w3w</strong>, which covers Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI, and other emerging technologies. Older issues are saved as HTML, newer ones as markdown.

I started the newsletter as a personal project in 2017. In its early iterations, it was sometimes published on an occasional basis, under a few different titles.

That said, #w3w has had one thematic throughline that's been consistent from the beginning: a focus on how we can use new tools to build a web that truly works for everyone.

The newsletter is published every Sunday. To subscribe, visit https://w3wnews.substack.com
