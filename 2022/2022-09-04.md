**August couldn't end soon enough for crypto traders,** who suffered a "bleak month," [according to Coinbase](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/31/first-mover-americas-a-bleak-month-for-crypto-as-bitcoin-slides-ether-stalls-and-solana-tanks/). Unfortunately, there's still a lot of uncertainty ahead for fall as well.

Six of the top ten tokens by valuation [posted monthly declines](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/4YCLMJGCPNCGTBAPATJZTWXQRM.png) in August, led by a 21% plunge in Solana. Bitcoin dropped 12%, and ether slipped 2%. The global token market's capitalization fell nearly 11% to end the month just under $1 trillion, according to data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/).

One bright spot amid all the bloodletting: Adjusted transaction volume in stablecoins leapt 33% in August to a record $866.2 billion, according to [The Block Research](https://www.theblock.co/post/167659/adjusted-transaction-volume-of-stablecoins-soared-almost-33-in-august).

The surge seemed to be a byproduct of recent U.S. Treasury [sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916) against transaction "mixer" Tornado Cash. The crackdown has apparently forced more trading activity in stablecoins into the open, according to The Block.

Looking ahead, Ethereum is expected to complete its long-anticipated Merge in September, moving the popular network to a new proof-of-stake protocol for verifying transactions. App developers have generally been favorable on the [technical benefits](https://www.theblock.co/post/166868/after-the-merge-nearly-all-nfts-will-be-environmentally-friendly) of the network upgrade, but the implications for markets are [less clear](https://cointelegraph.com/news/surge-or-purge-why-the-merge-may-not-save-ethereum-price-from-septembear) so far.

Also worrisome for traders heading into fall: The U.S. Federal Reserve's [tough stance on inflation](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-seen-sticking-to-interest-rate-hikes-even-as-unemployment-rises/ar-AA11oAkM), which is spurring higher interest rates and increased aversion to risk among investors. That in turn has created serious headwinds for stocks, crypto, and other assets that may continue awhile longer.

The week's other big headlines:

- **Bitcoin mining difficulty** has risen 9.3% over the last two weeks, the biggest increase since January, according to [The Block Research](https://www.theblock.co/post/166757/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-jumps-9-26-in-the-largest-increase-since-january). However, Bitcoinist reports that on-chain transaction activity among users has [remained weak](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-on-chain-activity-bleeds/).

- **A sample of people surveyed in 19 developed countries** increasingly consider online misinformation a "major threat" to their national security, according to the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/08/31/climate-change-remains-top-global-threat-across-19-country-survey/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=22-08-31%20GLOBAL%20International%20Threats%20and%20Coop%20GEN%20DISTR&org=982&lvl=100&ite=10400&lea=2186992&ctr=0&par=1&trk=a0D3j000011fU79EAE).
