# #Web3 Weekly: July 17-23, 2022

**Crypto markets had a busy week,** accompanied as ever by some noteworthy developments around products, regulation, and more. Let's get to it:

- **Ether's price leapt 19%** for the week as traders' expectations grew that a [full "merge"](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/15/ethereums-merge-projected-for-september-according-to-soft-timeline/) of the Ethereum network into a new, more eco-friendly method for verifying transactions is coming soon. The Ethereum Foundation's Tim Beiko said he [anticipates](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/15/ethereums-merge-projected-for-september-according-to-soft-timeline/) a full rollout the week of Sept. 19.

- **ETH's gains,** along with an 8% weekly rally in bitcoin, helped propel the broader crypto market higher. Global crypto market cap rose 8% on the week to reclaim the $1 trillion threshold for the first time since mid-June, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) data.

- **Tesla has sold most of its bitcoin.** The automaker has sold $936 million of the token -- about three-fourths of its holdings. But it has held onto its Dogecoin, CNET [reports](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/tesla-sold-936m-of-bitcoin-kept-its-dogecoin-reserves/).

- **U.S. authorities indicted** a former Coinbase product manager, his brother, and a friend on insider trading charges -- a first-of-its-kind case in the crypto industry. The trio allegedly used confidential information to make $1.1 million in profits on tokens that were about to be listed on Coinbase. Because the exchange itself is a publicly listed company, this [fell under the existing jurisdiction](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/07/21/ex-coinbase-manager-two-others-indicted-in-alleged-11-million-crypto-insider-trading-scheme/) of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

- **Crypto.com mobile users** will soon be able to buy tokens with their Google Pay wallets via a [new app feature](https://bitcoinist.com/google-pay-to-allow-customers-to-buy-crypto/).

- **Crypto's user base could top 1 billion people globally by year end,** according to a new [research report](https://github.com/Foresight-Ventures/Research/blob/main/What%20Does%20the%20Future%20Hold%20for%20Crypto%20Exchanges_Eng_Jul%202022.pdf) jointly published by Boston Consulting Group, BitGet, and Foresight Ventures.

- **Facebook parent Meta** may be [on the verge](https://slate.com/technology/2022/07/facebook-earnings-q2-revenue-slowdown.html) of reporting its first quarterly revenue decline next week, according to Slate's Alex Kantrowitz. Separately, the Wall Street Journal [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-shifts-resources-from-news-tab-and-bulletin-to-focus-on-creator-economy-11658250433?st=hkj0el6qvldml7a) that Meta is shifting engineering and product support resources away from news and toward features for individual creators of content for the metaverse and short-form video.

- **Surprising twists in the streaming wars:** Netflix said it will [partner with Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/13/netflix-partners-with-microsoft-on-ad-supported-subscription-plan.html) to launch a new ad-supported subscription plan. Meanwhile, Hulu is [growing subscribers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hulu-walt-disney-company-streaming-11658073114?mod=hp_lead_pos4) faster than Disney+, despite the latter's offering of Marvel and Star Wars content. WTF...

- **A bit off-topic but important:** Why aren't heat pumps more popular? The technology is energy efficient and effective at both heating and cooling, but rarely used in buildings, according to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/21/europe-heat-wave-heat-pump/). Hmmm...
