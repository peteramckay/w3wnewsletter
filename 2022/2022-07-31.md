# A big metaverse question
## #Web3 Weekly: July 24-30, 2022

**A serious question:** What problem does the metaverse solve?

This is supposed to be one of the basic requirements that any truly transformative technology can meet. But to be honest, I've never quite been able to discern what the answer is for the metaverse.

Sure, I can see how it would be useful in training certain very specialized occupations like surgeons and pilots. I can also see how some cool video games could be built with it. But then there are the more over-the-top statements you increasingly hear out of Silicon Valley about potential mass adoption. As in:

*"Everyone is going to live in the metaverse in five years!"*

For me, that sort of stuff is a bridge too far right now. I just don't see any path to it.

But hey. Maybe I'm wrong. If you've got a serious pro-metaverse answer to the above, I'm honestly interested to hear. Please email me direct at peter[at]pmckay.com.

I should also give a shout-out here to venture investor Jason Calicanis, whose [hilariously dismissive](https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1552444673117274112) take regarding the metaverse on Wednesday got me thinking. If you're a metaverse fan feeling triggered right now by anything I said earlier, I offer Jason as evidence that things could indeed be worse. ☺️

On to the latest headlines:

- **Bloomberg News reports** that the Securities and Exchange Commission is [investigating](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/coinbase-faces-sec-investigation-over-cryptocurrency-listings) whether Coinbase facilitates U.S. trading of tokens that should be registered securities. Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, vehemently denied that the exchange lists securities in a new [blog post](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-does-not-list-securities-end-of-story-e58dc873be79).

- **Two times is the charm.** Crypto prices [rallied](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/29/market-wrap-bitcoin-and-other-cryptos-gain-for-second-straight-week/) for a second straight week despite the Federal Reserve making a second [super-sized rate hike](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/business/economy/fed-interest-rate-inflation.html) to fight U.S. inflation. Bitcoin rose 5% on the week, and total valuation of the global crypto market topped $1.1 trillion, up almost 7%, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) data.

- **A senior International Monetary Fund analyst** said in an [interview](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/29/cryptos-slide-hasnt-bled-into-the-real-economy-imf-official-says/) with CoinDesk on Friday that crypto's longer-term retreat from its fall highs hasn't bled into the broader global financial system.

- **A Brazilian soccer team** bought the contract of a player in Argentina using [a USDC token transfer](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/29/two-soccer-teams-transfer-a-south-american-player-using-usdc-but-theres-collateral-damage/) via the exchange Bitso. The deal is the first of its kind in South American football.

- **Instagram is becoming** way too much [like TikTock](https://slate.com/technology/2022/07/instagram-tik-tok-kylie-jenner-social-media-terrible.html), says Slate's Dorie Chevlen.
