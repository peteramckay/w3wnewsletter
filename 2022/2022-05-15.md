**In the spring of 2000, the first dotcom bubble burst** in [spectacular fashion](https://internationalbanker.com/history-of-financial-crises/the-dotcom-bubble-burst-2000/). As we all know, the crash then *totally* ended the internet as a transformative force in society and every form of industry under the sun, in every country on earth, ever since.

Just kidding about that last part, of course. With the benefit of hindsight, yes, we now roll our eyes at the excesses of the dotcom era, including companies like [Pets.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyyq_aMPCtg) and others whose eye-popping valuations ultimately [went to zero](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/the-greatest-defunct-web-sites-and-dotcom-disasters/). But time has also shown that the technology underlying the dotcoms was pretty important after all, that some things with real value were indeed built and persist to this day (Google, Amazon, PayPal, eBay, et cetera), and innovation to improve upon that era's advances has continued regardless of fluctuations in asset markets.

The dotcom era even gave us the [concept](http://www.linux-kongress.org/1997/raymond.html) of open-source technology, which -- gasp! -- doesn't require companies at all. The Linux operating system, for instance, launched in the '90s and has continued to evolve and grow in popularity, right through the 2000 crash and beyond. Last year, NASA even used it to fly a drone [on Mars](https://www.pcmag.com/news/linux-is-now-on-mars-thanks-to-nasas-perseverance-rover).

These lessons from history strike me as worth remembering right now, following the week's undeniably historic [plunge in crypto markets](https://slate.com/technology/2022/05/bitcoin-and-crypto-crash-a-guide-for-normies.html). Worries about the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes and U.S. economic growth caused investors to unload riskier assets at a rapid clip, including stocks and crypto.

The global market capitalization of all tokens plunged by almost $400 million for the week, down 24% through Saturday afternoon, according to data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/).

That said, I still believe in the long-term potential of decentralized technology, even if we hit some bumps along the way, including the outright demise of some companies and projects. As in many things, I think the challenge here is to see shades of gray, not just black and white.

The market losses are of course painful, but at the same time, that doesn't necessarily change the broader trends favoring increased decentralization over time. For instance, people's skepticism of Big Tech's influence on their lives and privacy is still very much intact, which opens opportunities for alternative computing platforms. Similarly, worries about the stability and influence of the U.S. dollar globally should continue to create an opening for cryptocurrencies in the years ahead.

Some other recent headlines to flesh out the picture here:

- **Bear watching.** Wall Street's traditional definition of a bear market for an asset is a 20% decline from its high. By that standard, crypto has been in a bear market for some time, but the losses deepened last week, with global crypto market cap down to $1.3 trillion, off almost 60% from its November record. The market's two biggest tokens have each posted similar declines over the same period, with bitcoin recently trading around $30,000 and ether just above $2,000. Meanwhile, the stock market is hovering just shy of bear territory for now. As of Friday's closing bell in New York, the S&P 500 is down 16% from its January high.

- **TerraUSD melted down.** The stablecoin [lost its peg](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/13/the-human-cost-of-lunatic-hubris/) to the dollar, setting off an as yet unsuccessful effort to shore up its reserves. TerraUSD (UST) recently traded under [18 cents](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/). The [episode](https://decrypt.co/100434/what-happened-terras-bitcoin-reserve-ust-luna-crashed) is likely to reverberate for some time throughout the stablecoin sector, increasing scrutiny from regulators and investors concerned about how such tokens are backed financially. Competitor Tether also wobbled last week, [falling to 95 cents](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/crypto-collapse-intensifies-stablecoin-tether-slides-below-dollar-peg-2022-05-12/) at its low, but it has since recovered its peg to the dollar. Meanwhile, USDC and DAI have held up much better.

- **Billionaire Elon Musk** put his acquisition of Twitter ["on hold,"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1525049369552048129) ostensibly so he can better confirm the company's claim that less than 5% of accounts are fakes and bots. He left unspoken the thoroughly implausible possibility that the recent slide in stock prices for [both Twitter and Tesla](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tesla-twitter-shares-drop-elon-musks-legal-issues-84681258), whose shares he's offering as collateral to help finance the acquisition, might have anything to do with the pause. Totally unrelated events, I'm sure.

- **CoinDesk's content chief Michael J. Casey** expects the Fed's rate tightening [to be short-lived](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/13/why-the-fed-will-go-back-to-easy-money/). The hitch my old Dow Jones colleague sees is that U.S. economy is likely to tip into recession soon, which could force the U.S. central bank's hand. It will likely have to resume rate cuts to stimulate growth, which in turn will undermine the dollar's value and possibly even confidence in the dollar-based global financial system in general. That in turn should help token markets rebound, according to Casey.

- **Celebrities punked out en masse.** NBC News [reached out to 10 celebrities](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptos-steep-decline-investors-worried-celebrity-boosters-say-rcna28544) who have plugged various crypto startups and products on TV to get their response to the week's market plunge. Guess how many wouldn't comment? (Hint: It's a double-digit number.)
