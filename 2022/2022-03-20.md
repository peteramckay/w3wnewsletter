# #Web3Weekly
## March 13-19, 2022

**How mainstream is web3 becoming?** Put it this way: Tom Brady just [tweeted](https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1505295283286167554) a fan letter to Vitalik Buterin, who apparently wasn't previously aware of who Tom Brady is.

Some context that really puts the latest headlines in perspective, I think...

## Blogchain highlights

The Capsule team announced a bunch of cool stuff to push the platform forward and help newcomers:

- **We published a three-part series of posts** covering decentralization basics for writers. It answers three frequently asked questions: What is [blockchain](http://lnkd.in/e-Sd8XHt)? What is [cryptocurrency](http://lnkd.in/eE8mDiCY)? And what is [web3](http://lnkd.in/et4jSiqH)?
- **The engineering team** released the first major [feature updates](https://blogchain.app/post/bafyreihwq5ixt2xdubvigh2okqcfqzkdixgfjl64s5d6jjzz7yhal3ry4e) to the platform, including improvements in social sharing, content discoverability, and more.
- **We're looking for a new front-end engineer** to help improve Blogchain's text editor and better support writers' creativity. Full details [here](https://join.com/companies/capsule/4160778-frontend-engineer).
- **Capsule CEO Nadim Kobeissi** was [interviewed on France 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHT4GdVOEdA) about the recent hack of Solana, decentralized finance in general, and web3. Of course, he got in a plug for the home team in the process as well. ðŸ˜‰
