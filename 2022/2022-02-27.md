# #Web3Weekly

## Feb. 20-26, 2022

Honestly, there is only one decentralization story on my mind right now: The impending launch of [Capsule Social](https://capsule.social)'s new web3 publishing platform in March.

For [those of us working on the launch](https://www.capsule.social/about/team), it's been a busy, exciting and, yes, sometimes nerve-wracking time. So I hope you'll forgive me a little self-indulgence with this installment of the newsletter.

Some Capsule-related links and updates to pass along:

- **Early access to the new platform** will be granted on an invitation-only basis when it goes live, with priority given to writers who want to create content. If you'd like to request an invite, here's [the form](https://forms.zohopublic.com/peter96/form/BlogchainInviteRequests/formperma/7xCuELT6HdgR08w13-Nt8WFx9SmsnZh1YFL9mcP_oCc).

- **Capsule's founder and CEO Nadim Kobeissi** gave a [presentation about the new platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0VaA2LOh34), including a brief demo, at the NEARCon conference in the fall. NEARCon is a gathering for projects building on the NEAR protocol, which definitely includes Capsule. Other web3 technologies we're using include [OrbitDB](https://orbitdb.org/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), for decentralized, censorship-resistant storage of content.

- **Capsule** also has a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/HhVbaD2BHY), a company [newsletter](https://forms.zohopublic.com/peter96/form/Signup/formperma/3ARxdxcBPXRPkmY8w_NpMpzF8MRUGX04yzFQuaq-d9g), and an official [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/capsulesoc) if you would like to follow us on any of those channels.

- **If you're a member of the press** who would like to talk more about Capsule, please email me direct at peter[at]capsule.social.

- **Once the new platform launches**, I'll be posting more links on my personal Twitter to content from the new system. If that (or occasional rants about the Major League Baseball [lockout](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/nightengales-notebook-mlbs-lockout-is-doing-more-permanent-damage-every-single-day/ar-AAUofAe)) are of interest, you can [follow me here](https://twitter.com/peteramckay).
