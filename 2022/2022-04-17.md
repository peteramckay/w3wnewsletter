**Yesterday morning, I happily discovered** the Coachella Music Festival [streaming on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/coachella). Specifically, a replay of Carly Rae Jepson's performance Friday evening was on at the time.

Honestly, I don't particularly like or dislike Jepson's music. But the possibilities this opened up for this weekend and next!

Less happily, my reaction then ran through several other phases:
1. *"Wow. Guess this is another live event adjusting to our post-COVID world."*
2. Out of curiosity, search for articles about Coachella's decision to livestream.
3. Learn that Coachella has [been livestreamed on YouTube for 10 years](https://variety.com/2022/music/news/coachella-livestream-youtube-watch-online-1235233209/).
4. *"F#%@. I'm just old and/or uncool."*

Let's just get on to some headlines about decentralization, shall we?
