**I hate to be the bearer of bad news,** but on the bright side, I am well-practiced at it:

- **FTX had its initial hearing in a U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware,** highlighted by some [blistering remarks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/ftx-lawyer-says-in-first-bankruptcy-hearing-this-is-different-animal.html) from its own lawyer criticizing the exchange's top management. FTX counsel James Bromley said FTX was a "different sort of animal" and was run as "a personal fiefdom of Sam Bankman-Fried," the exchange's founder who recently resigned as CEO. Bromley added: "Unfortunately, the FTX debtors were not particularly well run, and that is an understatement."

- **ColdFusion's Dagogo Altraide** just posted a nice half-hour [explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20BEJouWBgY) of the FTX mess and how it came about. Handy background for anyone who would like to get up to speed on the situation quickly, I think.

- **Crypto lender Genesis Global Capital** is racing to raise money to [cover its losses](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/news/crypto-lender-genesis-under-regulatory-probe-in-multiple-u-s-states) related to FTX. Meanwhile, regulators from Alabama and several other U.S. states are [investigating](https://www.barrons.com/articles/crypto-lender-genesis-probe-regulators-51669391920) whether Genesis violated securities laws in their jurisdictions.

- **Coinbase shares** hit an all-time low of $41.23 per share on Monday, knocking the company's valuation as a public company below $10 billion [for the first time](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-worth-less-than-2410-billion-for-the-first-time-as-e2-80-98crypto-winter-e2-80-99-continues-to-set-in/ar-AA14nHrv). Shares have since staged a partial comeback, recently trading above $44 per share. But investors generally remain wary of crypto exchanges for now.

- **CoinMarketCap began publishing data** about trading activity on [major crypto exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/). The popular data site has also created a proprietary ranking system that factors in CoinMarketCap's assessment of the reliability of data reported by each trading venue.

- **Just over half of all Bitcoin network addresses** are now [showing net losses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/21/more-than-50-of-bitcoin-addresses-are-now-in-loss/) from holding the popular cryptocurrency. This is the first time the proportion of accounts in the red has risen over 50% since March 2020, CoinDesk reports.

- **New York became the first U.S. state** to ban new crypto mining operations [at fossil fuel plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/nyregion/crypto-mining-ban-hochul.html).

- **World Crypto Day is set for Jan. 3.** A grassroots coalition is organizing the event with a [focus on investor education](https://www.worldcrypto.day/). Nice!

- **The inaugural American Metaverse Summit & Awards** will take place [March 2023 in Miami](https://www.americanmetaverseawards.com/). Nominations for the awards portion of the event are welcome through Dec.2 [here](https://www.americanmetaverseawards.com/nominations.html).

- **Slate's Alex Kantrowitz** says a single strategic mistake, repeated across most Big Tech companies, led to their recent round of disappointing earnings: They all [failed to anticipate](https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/meta-amazon-shopify-tech-layoffs-pandemic.html) a post-lockdown resumption of people spending more time on (gasp!) offline activities. Hmmm...
