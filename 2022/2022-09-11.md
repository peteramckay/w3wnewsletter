**For a change,** I want to highlight some excellent podcasts and videos covering our usual tech-y subject matter around here.

As it happens, I've come across several good ones the last few days. Hence a good opportunity to break from my usual article-heavy focus this time:

- **Laura Shin interviewed BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes** about the Ethereum network's pending Merge event on her podcast [Unchained](https://unchainedpodcast.com/arthur-hayes-former-ethereum-skeptic-on-why-the-merge-makes-him-bullish-on-eth-ep-393/). Hayes previously counted himself as an Ethereum skeptic, but he's now bullish on the platform due to its move to a new proof-of-stake protocol for verifying transactions.

- **I really liked marketing guru Gary Vanyerchuck's recent comments** about web3 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=171n4q2bZRA), comparing it closely to the web1 era. The jist: Yes, there are a lot of excesses right now, a lot of speculation, and companies that won't make it. But there is also stuff being built that will indeed be of lasting value. *Both parts are true at once.* We should resist the urge to make it binary, just one thing or the other.

- **Podcaster Peter McCormack** spoke with author Eric Yates about the [future of bitcoin-based banking](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/bitcoin-banking-in-2050). As the bitcoin market matures, and the ecosystem of supporting technologies like the Lightning Network expands, Yates expects bitcoin to take on more of the roles now fulfilled by conventional banks.

- **The Land of the Giants podcast,** which covers Big Tech, just finished its [sixth season](https://www.theverge.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast), focused on Facebook parent Meta. The highlight for me was their [episode](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/10/23300246/trump-facebook-election-land-of-the-giants) on Facebook's evolving moderation standards and their role in the 2016 election, especially given Donald Trump's antics on the platform. This topic has been covered a ton the last few years, obviously. But if you want a thorough half-hour summary of how the situation went off the rails, I don't think you'll find a better one than LOTG's work here.

- **CNN reports** that a Michigan voting machine somehow turned up [for sale on eBay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgn1D8h8G7A) after being dropped off at a thrift shop. Authorities are investigating.

- **Finally, a classic that's always worth re-sharing:** Wired's excellent [explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYip_Vuv8J0) covering what blockchain is at five different levels of complexity, from a five-year-old's level of understanding on up. Four years after it was posted, this one still holds up as a great place to start if you want to understand the basics around this new technology.
