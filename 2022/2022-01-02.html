        <h4>Dec. 26, 2021 to Jan. 1, 2022</h4></span>

        <p data-selectable-paragraph="" id="0558"><strong>Crypto markets roared in 2021</strong>&nbsp;despite ending with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/29/cryptocurrency-prices-fall-in-december-and-investors-blame-omicron-climate-change.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">whimper in the last few months</a>.</p>

        <p data-selectable-paragraph="" id="73b6">In this second installment of my two-part annual wrapup, let&rsquo;s talk markets a bit. (In<a href="https://peteramckay.medium.com/2021s-top-web3-stories-8c1958a39fd6" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Part 1</a>, I counted down my top stories and themes of the year.)</p>

        <p data-selectable-paragraph="" id="7d01">To start, a quick snapshot of how crypto performed in 2021 versus traditional assets:</p>

        <ul>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="d1b4"><strong>Bitcoin:</strong>&nbsp;+59%</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="3c2f"><strong>Ether:</strong>&nbsp;+409%</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="b6db"><strong>Global Crypto Market Cap:</strong>&nbsp;+191%</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="6ebb"><strong>S&amp;P 500:</strong>&nbsp;+27%</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="009a"><strong>US Dollar Index:</strong>&nbsp;+6.4%</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="466c"><strong>Gold:</strong>&nbsp;-3.4%</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="4130"><strong>Crude Oil:</strong>&nbsp;+56%</li>
        </ul>

        <p data-selectable-paragraph="" id="bfac">There&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>a lot </em>to be said&nbsp;hiding between the lines of those stats, of course. Here are a few observations offhand, as well as some additional factoids of interest now that 2021 is behind us:</p>

        <ul>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="13a3"><strong>Global crypto market valuation started the year around $700 billion,&nbsp;</strong>then more than quadrupled to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/cryptocurrencies-hit-market-cap-of-3-trillion-for-the-first-time-as-bitcoin-and-ether-reach-record-highs/ar-AAQtYQv" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">record $3 trillion at its peak</a>&nbsp;in November. This is perhaps the ultimate measure of how mainstream crypto has gotten, helped by inflation fears, distrust of traditional banks, and other factors. To be sure, market cap has since retreated to $2.2 trillion in recent trading. But that&rsquo;s still a pretty hefty gain for the year, up more than three times from where we started.</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="7043"><strong>Crypto exchanges saw more than $14 trillion in trading volume in 2021,</strong>&nbsp;up 689% compared to 2020, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/128526/centralized-crypto-exchanges-14-trillion-trading-volume-2021" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">The Block Research</a>.</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="4d39"><strong>There are now 94 individual tokens with a valuation of at least $1 billion,</strong>&nbsp;according to data from&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a>. This of course is the valuation threshold that Silicon Valley investors traditionally use to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unicorn.asp" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">define</a>&nbsp;a &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; startup. Considering crypto didn&rsquo;t even exist before 2008, I&rsquo;d say that&rsquo;s a pretty solid pace of minting new &ldquo;unicorns.&rdquo; Any single venture capital firm would certainly be proud of it as a decade-plus track record if it led investment rounds for that many billion-dollar startups. In fairness, though, the comparison breaks down when we move to a collective framing. That is to say, the crypto market overall still isn&rsquo;t creating &ldquo;unicorns&rdquo; as fast as the VC industry&nbsp;<a href="https://techhq.com/2021/12/unicorn-startups-not-slowing-down-2021/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">taken as a whole</a>.</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="5db9"><strong>The overlap between crypto and traditional VC is growing as well.</strong>&nbsp;Digital asset companies raised about $30 billion in venture funding in 2021, up 450%. What&rsquo;s more, investment rounds have gotten bigger, with some&nbsp;deals now topping $700 million each, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://blockworks.co/2021-crypto-vc-funding-tops-30b-market-is-superheated/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Blockworks</a>.</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="f790"><strong>Bitcoin&rsquo;s share of the token market&rsquo;s global valuation has tumbled</strong>&nbsp;<strong>just under 40%</strong>, down from 70% at the start of 2021, according to CoinMarketCap. It strikes me the oldest cryptocurrency&rsquo;s role as a market leader is at an interesting crossroads as we head into the New Year. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s clearly no longer posting the biggest percentage gains in price as investors are increasingly betting on Web3 use cases for blockchain technology beyond finance. (Witness Ethereum&rsquo;s 409% jump in 2021, which smoked bitcoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;mere&rdquo; 59%.)That said, when bitcoin sags, other tokens tend to go with it. So it&rsquo;s still hard to imagine a broad crypto rally&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;bitcoin performing at least respectably well.</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="51b9"><strong>Bitcoin clearly stole some of gold&rsquo;s thunder in 2021&nbsp;</strong>as a hedge against inflation and other economic risks. As an ex-commodities reporter, it frankly shocks me to see gold down 3% for 2021, considering everyone from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/ezines/2021/12/15/benchmarks-surge-as-federal-reserve-turns-hawkish" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a>&nbsp;on down was increasingly worried about inflation as the year wound down. The only conclusion one can reach is that bitcoin effectively usurped some of the yellow metal&rsquo;s traditional role as a form of &ldquo;strong money&rdquo; at times when the paper sort is losing value. That&rsquo;s no small feat, considering gold has been at it for several thousand years.</li>
        	<li data-selectable-paragraph="" id="f5f2"><strong>On the other hand</strong>, bitcoin barely outperformed crude oil (up 59% versus 56%) in 2021. So maybe those crusty ol&rsquo; commodity traders in New York and London still have some life fight left&nbsp;in them yet. (Apologies to any of you reading this, of course. ðŸ™ƒ)</li>
