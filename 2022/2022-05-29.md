**Some truly historic milestones to share this week,** along with a dash of plain ol' blockchain-y weirdness, of course:

- **Coinbase was added to the Fortune 500,** taking the [#437](https://fortune.com/company/coinbase/fortune500/) slot. It thus became the first crypto company to make the prestigious list, which ranks U.S. companies by annual revenue. Nevertheless, the recent bear market has the exchange giant's stock price languishing [near its all-time low](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-makes-fortune-500-stock-025247664.html).

- **Lockheed Martin and the Filecoin Foundation** announced a project to [host nodes for the Interplanetary File System in space](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/blockchain-tech-could-literally-go-to-the-moon-with-lockheed-martin/). IPFS is already used here on earth for a number of decentralized aplications, but now it's going to truly live up to its lofty name.

- **Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon's proposal** to fork the Terra blockchain was [approved by token holders](https://fortune.com/2022/05/25/terra-blockchain-rebirth-vote-passed-crypto-ust-luna-do-kwon/). The plan could help investors recoup some of their steep losses on LUNA and UST tokens, whose meltdown earlier this month reverberated through global crypto markets.

- **The decentralized finance platform Uniswap** surpassed [$1 trillion in total trading volume](https://www.investing.com/analysis/uniswap-passes-1-trillion-in-trading-volume-200624824) dating back to its launch in late 2018.

- **MetaMask partnered with Asset Reality,** a London forensics firm, to help users recover stolen crypto funds. The wallet maker, which now boasts 30 million monthly active users, frequently gets support requests related to various scams, CoinDesk [reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/26/metamask-has-a-plan-to-help-victims-of-crypto-scams/).

- **Andreesen Horowitz** is raising a new [$4.5 billion crypto fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/25/andreessen-horowitz-raises-4point5-billion-crypto-fund-in-down-market.html) to shop for bargains amid the recent bear market. Talk about buying the dip...

- **Crypto was high on the agenda at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting** in Davos, Switzerland. Attendees were bombarded with crypto ads, parties sponsored by startups in the industry, and more staid panel discussions about stablecoins, the future of regulation, and other policy matters, [according to CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/23/at-davos-crypto-is-no-longer-on-the-outside/). (Full disclosure: I've previously done research and editing work for WEF regarding web3.)

- **A three-person team including Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin** co-authored a [whitepaper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) on "soulbound tokens," a proposed variation on non-fungible tokens that would be non-transferrable from one person to another. Proponents say SBTs could be handy for conferring on-chain university degrees and other use cases requiring strong identity verification.

- **Actor Seth Green** had to [stop production on a new animated series](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show) based on Bored Apes characters he purchased as NFTs. Seems Green was hacked in a phishing scheme, the NFTs were stolen, and thus his intellectual property rights are too uncertain to continue work on the series. D'oh!
