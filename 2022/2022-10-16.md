**Hard to believe, we're almost a year into the bear market in token prices**, sometimes not-so-lovingly referred to as "Crypto Winter. At this point, it's understandable to wonder whether the market has hit bottom or, at the very least, is one near?

In that spirit, I've been crunching some numbers worth sharing. First, let's take a look at the performance of crypto and conventional investments since Nov. 10, when bitcoin hit its all-time record above $68,000.

This is how these assets have performed so far through the entirety of Crypto Winter as of Friday's market close on Wall Street. I've arranged the list in descending order of positive returns to negative. I've also highlighted the S&P 500 since it's the benchmark among pro money managers:

- USD Index: +19.45%
- Crude Oil: +5.18%
- Gold: -10.68%
- **S&P 500: -22.89%**
- Nasdaq Composite: -33.93%
- Global Crypto Market Cap: -68.00%
- ETH: -72.01%
- BTC: -72.11%

No surprise that the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of other fiat currencies, is leading the way. It's benefited greatly from the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, which effectively reduce the supply of dollars flowing through the global economy.

Now let's take a look at the same set of assets' performance in just the second half of 2022, since June 30. Notice how the pecking order of gainers and losers changes:

- ETH: +21.43%
- USD Index: +8.22%
- Global Crypto Market Cap: +3.52%
- BTC: -3.20%
- **S&P 500: -5.34%**
- Nasdaq Composite: -6.41%
- Gold: -8.53%
- Crude Oil: -19.11%

All the crypto indicators have switched from lagging to *beating* the S&P, led by ether. That token benefited from heavy buying ahead of the Ethereum network's recent Merge, as well as its revamped monetary policy which continues to require regular ["burning" of tokens](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/13/ether-becomes-deflationary-for-first-time-since-the-merge-coinbase/) from the overall supply.

To be sure, the relative strength of crypto in the second half isn't slam-dunk proof that Crypto Winter is over. But it is definitely a ray of hope, at least.

On to the week's other notable headlines:

- **Coinbase and Google Cloud** announced a new [long-term strategic partnership](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-cloud-and-coinbase-launch-new-strategic-partnership-to-drive-web3-innovation-301645592.html).
