# Mounting casualties
## #Web3 Weekly: July 3-9, 2022

**Bear markets throughout history** have always rearranged the pecking order among investors and industries. Invariably, some participants don't make it, while others seize an opportunity to buy cheap assets that turn into fortunes later. And when the dust settles, the winners and losers may not be who you expect.

The week's tech headlines suggest such a winnowing is now underway in crypto and beyond:

- **Merger updates:** FTX [agreed to buy BlockFi](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-agrees-deal-blockfi-option-075136401.html) for up to $240 million, pending shareholder approval. Nexo is [in talks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/05/crypto-lender-nexo-offers-to-buy-embattled-rival-vauld.html) to acquire Vauld as part of a restructuring. Meanwhile, Elon Musk wants to [pull out](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/08/musk-scraps-42b-deal-to-buy-twitter-prompting-board-to-threaten-suit/) of his offer to buy Twitter for $42 billion, originally proposed in April.

- **Facebook parent Meta** said it will [shut down](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/04/meta-novi-pilot-ends/) its Novi crypto wallet service on Sept. 1. The social giant has been backing away from crypto payments in recent months after its earlier plans in the category were met with heavy skepticism among regulators in multiple countries.  

- **Widening woes for Celsius:** A former investment manager [sued the embattled crypto lender](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/08/crypto-lender-celsius-is-a-fraud-and-ponzi-scheme-lawsuit-claims.html) alleging mismanagement and fraud. Separately, Celsius cut another 150 employees -- about a quarter of its total workforce, according to [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/155647/crypto-lender-celsius-dismisses-a-quarter-of-its-employees-calcalist).

- **Brokerage Voyager Digital** [filed for Chapter 11 protection](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/06/crypto-firm-voyager-digital-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection.html) due to heavy exposure to the failed Three Arrows Capital.

- **The Block reports** that the recent security breach of gaming platform Axie Infinity was spurred by a senior engineer's response to a job application at a fictitious company set up by hackers. [Ouch](https://www.theblock.co/post/156038/how-a-fake-job-offer-took-down-the-worlds-most-popular-crypto-game).

- **OpeanSea co-founder Alex Atallah** said he will [step down](https://mirror.xyz/alexatallah.eth/-8HvcUeO6wkrzV5xLR-Uv_OljE_Xci1yI6jUBGYJvmU) from an active role in the popular platform for non-fungible tokens as of July 30. He will remain on the company's board, however.

- **HTC launched the Desire 22 Pro,** a mobile phone [optimized for metaverse apps](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/htc-launches-metaverse-phone-ethereum-032319535.html).

- **The American Bankers Association** said it opposes issuance of an official "digital dollar" by the Federal Reserve. The powerful trade group outlined its concerns in a [comment letter](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/ITA-2022-0003-0008) to the Commerce Department.

- **ICYMI:** NBC News recently aired a [report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlk0SPtXbg) on NASA's Artemis project, which aims to return astronauts to the moon by 2024. The project appears to be on track, especially since NASA hasn't wasted valuable resources and time trying to buy a social network it doesn't need. ðŸ™ƒ
