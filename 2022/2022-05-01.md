**There are a lot of critical stories about web3 that might be easy for an optimist about decentralization to dismiss.** Maybe the author doesn't really understand the technology, or they're just too much of a fan for a particular centralized platform, or something like that.

Then there are stories like BuzzFeed's recent [takedown of MetaDocs](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emilybakerwhite/metadocs-nfts-tiktok-instagram-celebrity-doctors), a telehealth project employing non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The lede alone is a masterpiece:

*A group of TikTok- and Instagram-famous physicians say they have a solution for the “red tape” of the current medical system: NFTs of cartoon doctors.*

Ouch. The tale of cartoonish claims and shaky (at best) deliverables just goes from there.

I think the story is nevertheless still worth a read for web3 optimists, though, as it's a useful reminder how difficult it is to address certain real-world use cases like improving people's healthcare. And that's ultimately the only way web3 will gain needed credibility with the massses.

Bold predictions and sheer enthusiasm for the technology aren't enough; we have to truly solve users' real problems.

On to the latest headlines:
