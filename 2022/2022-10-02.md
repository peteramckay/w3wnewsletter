The latest headlines about decentralization:

- **FTX made some big moves.** The exchange [acquired the assets](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voyager-completes-successful-auction-and-announces-agreement-for-ftx-to-acquire-its-assets-301633679.html) of bankrupt crypto broker Voyager Digital for $1.4 billion.

- **Binance announced the launch** of a [new mining pool](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/29/binance-starts-ethereum-proof-of-work-mining-pool-initially-with-no-fee/) for ETHW, a recently launched version of ether that preserves the Ethereum's old proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. ETHW was built as a haven for miners adversely affected by the Ethereum network's [recent transition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2022/09/22/the-ethereum-merge-is-over-now-what/) to an alternative proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol for the network's flagship ETH token.
