 _**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

 _**About me: I'm a New York-based writer and marketer with more than seven years' experience creating content about web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning at the time about blockchain technology and decentralization with other people interested in such stuff.**_

  _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done marketing and content work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_
