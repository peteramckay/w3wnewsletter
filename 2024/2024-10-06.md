**Today I'm excited to share some changes I'm making** to my publishing workflow, including new value-added content for paid subscribers [on Substack](https://w3wnews.substack.com/subscribe). I'm adding two new projects:

- **Year in Review & 2025 Outlook:** For w3w's Founding Members, I'm working on a new package of content that will look back at this year's major developments and ahead to key tech trends that I see coming in the New Year. This will launch with a members-only webinar in December, complemented by a long-form report that will go out as a PDF. (Founding Members will get the slides from the webinar as well, of course.) If you want to get a jump on 2025's major developments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI, and other emerging technologies re-shaping the web, this option is for you!

- **Intro to Web3:** This will be a webinar open to all paid subscribers who want to understand blockchain tech at a high level. The presentation will be accessible and non-technical, with no investment advice or token picks. But it should be a helpful starting point/backgrounder if you want to delve into such things later on your own. I'll launch this one early in 2025, and it will repeat periodically for newcomers.

Going forward, w3w will also be moving to a more flexible publication schedule for email updates to all subscribers, including the free tier.

This regular Sunday email blast will continue, but it will be strictly a bulleted news summary beginning next week. Longer standalone posts will go out periodically whenever they're ready, when news breaks, or when something just grabs my attention that I urgently want to share.

The general idea here is that I've been weighing some new options for w3w, both creatively and in terms of revenue, since the newsletter's migration to Substack in August.

Now that I've learned more about the new platform, I'm rolling out some of those ideas. I truly believe the changes described above will preserve the things that people have told me they already love about w3w. At the same time, I'm glad to add some new elements to the mix as well.

In particular, I see the Annual Outlook and Intro to Web3 webinars as great ways to emphasize the big picture, to help you cut through the frenzy of daily incremental developments in tech.

### Week in Review: Sept. 29 to Oct. 5, 2024

- **Bitcoin posted its strongest September in 11 years,** up [more than 7%](https://www.ibtimes.com/bitcoin-logs-best-september-performance-over-decade-3745092) for the month. An interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and stimulus spending by the Chinese government [propelled the rally](https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/digital-assets/matthew-sigel-vaneck-crypto-monthly-recap-for-september-2024/). Led by bitcoin, the broader token market's global valuation rose to $2.25 trillion at month's end, up nearly 9%, according to [CoinMarketCap data](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/). Ethereum was a notable laggard to the monthly rally, however, off 4%.

- **OpenAI closed a funding round** that valued the company [at $157 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/openai-raises-at-157-billion-valuation-microsoft-nvidia-join-round.html), more than quintuple its price tag in 2023. However, the company has seen a round of executive departures lately that [concerns some management experts](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/openai-leadership-exodus-why-management-120019058.html). Among the notable exits: Chief Technology Officer [Mira Murati](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/tech/openai-technology-chief-mira-murati-leaving/index.html).

- **Binance founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao** took to Twitter following [his recent release](https://news.google.com/read/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQWGUycTZkWFNDWHllQTB1bkIybm9KVzM2ODZOWFA3WmluVW1pMk5HR3p5SGtkaGN0UUhwT0FQemczbElxTHZkZE5vZ3ZVdnZqYk1rSi0tWEkwVzBMQ2VjbkNpai1ySVU2TlZEaS1QWmpRc2FkUk14SFc3OFRIcFRNSlRmeVVqcFZGZmZWWm9uMUJudDZJSGdJ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) from a four-month prison sentence in the U.S. In [a tweet](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1840265403882152232) on Sept. 29, CZ said his post-prison plans aren't fully set. But the billionaire plans to continue investing in crypto and to spend a lot of time on Giggle Academy, an online education project.

- **Crypto payments in focus:** Ripple received regulatory approval to offer token-based payments [in Dubai](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/10/41125099/ripple-receives-dubai-approval-for-blockchain-payment-services)... PayPal CEO Alex Chrisshas said in an [interview with Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/paypal-ceo-crypto-were-just-183001339.html) that he is bullish on crypto payments but has no interest in becoming an exchange to compete with the likes of Coinbase.

- **Donald Trump's new crypto project** World Liberty Financial began a [limited public release](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/30/24258815/world-liberty-financial-accredited-investors-know-your-customer-trump), accepting signups from accredited U.S. investors and foreigners. Separately, [ProPublica reports](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-media-truth-social-executives-ousted-devin-nunes) that Trump's media startup Truth Social has recently forced out several executives alleging mismanagement and retaliation by CEO and former congressman Devin Nunes.

- **New details emerged about Silicon Valley's richest political donors.** The Wall Street Journal reports that Elon Musk had [quietly been giving](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-political-donations-stephen-miller-desantis-39464294?st=ShEEmX&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) tens of millions of dollars to Republican politicians well before his highly publicized formation of a political action commmittee in May to support Trump... Andreessen Horowitz partner Ben Horowitz said he and his wife Felicia will [make a "significant donation"](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/04/ben-horowitz-endorse-kamala-harris) to Kamala Harris's campaign due to their longstandng personal friendship with the vice president. The move represents a notable break from his firm's previous endorsement of Trump, before Harris became the Democratic nominee... In the New Republic, my old friend Gil Duran covered Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong's [support for "network state" ideology](https://newrepublic.com/article/185738/coinbase-brian-armstrong-crypto-lobbying-washington-politicians) that advocates outright replacement of traditional nation-states with online communities. At the same time, Armstrong has been making inroads in Congress to influence U.S. crypto policy. Hmmm...

- **Humanity Protocol,** a new decentralized identity platform using zero-knowledge proofs, [launched its test network](https://www.humanity.org/blog/your-time-has-come-the-humanity-protocol-testnet-is-live) and began taking user signups.

### Odds & Ends

- **Slate's Henry Grabar reports** that state-level Departments of Transportion are often [obstacles to modernizing](https://slate.com/business/2024/10/road-safety-danger-traffic-deaths-federal-oversight-intervention.html) the design of American cities and towns for greater safety, walkability, and environmental friendliness. State DOTs frequently squelch such proposals from local officials in lieu of a more narrow focus on moving vehicular traffic through streets.

- **The world's longest treasure hunt has ended after more than 31 years.** On Thursday, someone found a golden owl statuette buried by author R√©gis Hauser somewhere in France back in 1993 to promote his book, On The Trail of the Golden Owl. Hauser died in 2009, but his illustrator Michel Becker had carried on with organizing the hunt since.

_**About me: I'm a New York-based creator with more than seven years' experience in marketing and content about web3.

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News.
