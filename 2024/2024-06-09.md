# Let's make a deal.
## Crypto world just saw a surprising flurry of dealmaking on Wall Street. What's going on here?

<p><em>By Peter A. McKay</em></p>

**Dealmaking is taking off among crypto companies.** My hunch is that this represents a mixed blessing, for reasons I'll describe further on. But first let's cover some details:

<!-- Transition: Good news is there's still smart money and innovation going on in blockchain, despite negative or nonexistant PR, long shadow of AI, etc. Bad news is many of these deals are a form of centralization, perhaps akin to formation of oligarchies that dominate web2. -->

### Odds & Ends

- **Galaxy Digital announced** it has [tokenized](https://www.galaxy.com/newsroom/galaxy-announces-tokenization-of-the-1708-stradivarius-violin-empress/) a 316-year-old Stradivarius violin.

- **Apollo-era astronaut William Anders** died at the age of 90 in a plane crash [northwest of Seattle](https://www.salon.com/2024/06/07/apollo-8-astronaut-captured-earthrise-photo-dies-in-plane-crash/?in_brief=true). A U.S. Air Force veteran, Anders famously became the first person to orbit the moon, in 1968. During that mission, he snapped the iconic [Earthrise](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg/1920px-NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg) photo that has since become a powerful symbol of mankind's exploration of space.

- **Serious question:** People who use and/or rave about the awesomeness of Apple's AirPod earbuds... How do you not lose them on a weekly basis? I know they've been out for years now, and I will confess I still don't get it. Seems like a massive scam to me. ðŸ¤·
