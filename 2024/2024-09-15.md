# Is ether really an "altcoin" at this point?
## Let's face it. Just like bitcoin, it's here to stay.

**For as long as I've been involved in web3,** the term "altcoin" has been shorthand for "everything other than bitcoin."

There is certainly at least one objective reason why such a distinction is useful: Bitcoin continues to have a comfortable majority share of the global token market. So-called "bitcoin dominance" now stands at 57% of the $2.1 trillion crypto market worldwide, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#bitcoin-dominance).

But I have always felt there is a squishier, more subjective connotation to "altcoin" as well. The term carries a whiff of "iffy stuff that might plausibly just go away at any moment."

As in: "We know this bitcoin thing will last. But all these other tokens? Meh."

Heck, the most hardcore bitcoiners, [known as maxis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-maximalism.asp), will even say such things out loud. Everyone else in crypto is mostly content just to imply it, purposefully or not.

For more than 99% of the 2.4 million tokens that CoinMarketCap tracks, I would even agree with that framing. Yes, most of those tokens could plausibly go to zero.

And, yes, bitcoin is fundamentally different, more mature, more integrated with conventional finance, with real scarcity and true decentralization, and thus likely to hang around for the long term.

But I would also say at this point that ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, represents a pretty similar exception. It's the number-two token by market cap, with a [$274 billion market cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) that comprises 14% of the global crypto market.

(Full disclosure: I do own small amounts of both ether and bitcoin.)

For perspective, here's how ether's valuation stacks up against the market caps of some notable public companies as of Friday's close on Wall Street:

- [Coca-Cola](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/): $308 billion
- [Netflix](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/): $299 billion
- **Ether:** $274 billion  
- [McDonald's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/): $213 billion
- [Uber](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UBER/): $152 billion
- [Goldman Sachs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GS/): $151 billion

Just as important, as a development platform, Ethereum has shown real [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) in recent years. Clearly, there are now people building on it because other people are building on it, which then attracts more people to build on it over time.

I know that may sound weird or crazy or even shady to some folks, but it's really not. It's similar to when you see users joining a social platform because their friends are joining it, which then makes the company running the social platform more valuable. This pattern is evident -- and it's purposefully cultivated and very powerful when executed correctly -- all through the tech industry.

For ether, it's also a good reason why the term "altcoin" might not really apply anymore.


### Week in Review: Sept. 8-14, 2024

- **New data suggest the gender pay gap is significantly wider in web3 finance than in web2.** Women earn 46% less than men in web3, versus a 36% disparity in web2, according to the newly issued Web3 Finance Compensation Report. Yikes. ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/08/29/what-web3-data-reveals-about-gender-inequality-in-the-crypto-industry/))

- **AI saw some splashy product announcements.** OpenAI launched a new chatbot model dubbed o1 that the company says "reasons" [more like a person](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/12/openai-unveils-a-model-that-can-fact-check-itself/), including better internal fact-checking of its responses. Meanwhile, Apple [unveiled the iPhone 16](https://www.chron.com/news/article/apple-iphone-ai-apple-intelligence-19754948.php), which features AI functionality that runs mostly on the device. Some early reviewers were lukewarm, however. The Washington Post's Geoffrey Fowler [wrote](https://news.google.com/read/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNdlBtYmVzLTBtcjZRdHFWc0t3enB2dW01NFFuaE1RRnpraDNFOVVKNFM5Qzd6VnVTUlc1eV82Mmp4SlF0YTJWT1JMbzU2WG01ZjVvSHVIb05MbDBkRmJyX2RES2lhZDJ1RzVieWtGUURCdjRHXzFmMVRrRDBLNzNXQ0JXeHJEWHhsVVRFbkdKTWVTbnA5N1BpT1F0V1c?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) that a test version of the new iPhone he received seemed prone to the sort of hallucinations that have dogged other publicly available AI systems. "We might just have to get used to some level of nonsense now spread all over our iPhones," Fowler says.

- **A state-backed company in the  United Arab Emirates** is in talks to invest in OpenAI. As part of the negotiations, which would reportedly value OpenAI at $150 billion, the company has said it expects $4 billion in revenue this year. But it isn't yet profitable. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/united-arab-emirates-fund-in-talks-to-invest-in-openai-fd4e4977?st=RjtXxh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

Separately, [Mastercard and Mercuryo](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/mastercard-launches-crypto-card-enabling-users-to-spend-in-100-million-european-merchants/ar-AA1q38Jf) announced a partnership to offer a crypto debit card in Europe allowing users to spend tokens with more than 100 million merchants.

In an [essay](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNaDZ2eTBwX25xUVh4S0Jua0ZjNHhiYnN3Qjd3LTNJUGZYbTVrYWdGZmR0b0c4eWhkLW4tc1ZyWVB4Rlc0VVQzWmpDY2JVNWY1R0ZhUW9UMGRybnVKeWR4Sk5KTTN0elFKRjVuUnZNcUM5cUFzQ0dzQV80MlpiT05DazVQREp4eTZWdGJkNHdQWHo5MFdIVkhvc0xJUVlZU2haMU0yV1Zqd2NlYXJzU0pfWGNZUQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) for The Economist, Draghi warned: "Growth in Europe has been slowing for decades... For most of this period, slowing growth could be seen as an inconvenience but not a calamity. No more."
