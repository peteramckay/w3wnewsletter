**Like a lot of Americans,** I spent much of the week reading and watching election post mortems.

Yes, prior to Tuesday's vote, we had in hand months of polling data, probability modeling, and prediction markets showing a close presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Still, I think most people will  agree that seeing Trump actually complete his political comeback was stunning in a certain way, whether you supported him or not. ([I didn't](https://x.com/peteramckay/status/1847230808894886058), for the record.)

If anything, the election result just created whole new questions about how and why that sit mostly outside the scope of simple [horserace-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_race_journalism) campaign metrics. The sheer variety of answers on offer in the U.S. press right now is truly stunning, some of them so directly contradictory it's kind of hilarious. Fittingly, Comedy Central host Desi Lydic captured the phenomenon nicely in [her post mortem monologue](https://youtu.be/hPHH5trgC1w?si=Cp7DusX1XF6QNrCE&t=235).

Sprinkled among her jokes, Lydic dropped this dead-serious truth bomb: "Honestly, i don't really care why she lost. I care why *he won*."

In that spirit, I have to say the subgenre of election analysis that prioritizes inflation to explain Trump's win strikes me as the most convincing. I say that because, compared to the other theories out there, it seems uniquely validated by [global events lately](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents), not just the U.S. situation, and by [history](https://reason.com/2022/10/13/inflation-remixed/).

On Thursday, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch offered a [sobering assessment](https://news.google.com/read/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Oc3hOZ2ZkNFRFLXRTbXUyQ2dfaHh5WHBnODE5ZEMyY3JINnBhQ2UzZzFoTlIycTJmSDRjTWplUTBMSDZCeGtXOGpWbUljcmo3WjFjTUtpcGRFLWwxU0RtOFAyU1BfMk5tN180eF9IV0g?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) from a remarkable series of elections around the world:

*<blockquote>Economic and geopolitical conditions of the past year or two have created arguably the most hostile environment in history for incumbent parties and politicians across the developed world.*

*From America’s Democrats to Britain’s Tories, Emmanuel’s Macron’s Ensemble coalition to Japan’s Liberal Democrats, even to Narendra Modi’s erstwhile dominant BJP, governing parties and leaders have undergone an unprecedented series of reversals this year.*

*The incumbents in every single one of the 10 major countries that have been tracked by the ParlGov global research project and held national elections in 2024 were given a kicking by voters. This is the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of records.*</blockquote>

Central to this political narrative is inflation, which was a widespread  phenomenon globally during the COVID outbreak. Governments in many countries -- including but by no means limited to America -- essentially printed money through lower interest rates and fiscal stimulus to get through pandemic-related shutdowns of businesses.

That money printing in turn devalued major currencies -- the very essence of *what inflation is*. That has created a lingering, visceral sticker shock that voters have taken out [on incumbent-party politicians worldwide](https://news.google.com/read/CBMikwFBVV95cUxORW1WSHZGMVFRZXg0Q3lnX2d5RDlZRGhlYWR5TDNTcjZBdDZhYzRWWk81aG8tNUh6ZllCQkhKeEZYRk5vTFhUSThKMnNDOXl2ODhaUERfU1N0ZFJBQ05zbUktQUhSNk9fUFlYZC1jT3h5LTFUclhpcWVXZmt3RWNOVHBxdlNicGFTci1YNkNDNkxpdEE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen).

The perils of such "easy money" policies are a familar topic to many bitcoiners. Hence the reason I'm glad to highlight it here, in a newsletter ostensibly about technology. (Fear not. I haven't forgotten.)

As I've said before, bitcoiners [don't get enough nearly credit](https://github.com/peteramckay/w3wnewsletter/blob/master/2022/2022-06-19.md) for their diagnosis and analysis of inflation. Even if you don't care to buy bitcoin yourself, bitcoiners are often worth listening to regarding inflation purely for the sake of understanding the macroeconomics of it better.

Perhaps even more important right now: Politicians could generally stand to think and talk about inflation more like bitconers do, if they want to succeed. That was evident during the recent U.S. presidential campaign, and I think it will continue to be so during Trump's new term.

Again, bitcoiners' default explanation of inflation: If you print more money, its value tends to go down. The end.

During the recent campaign, Harris seemed bent on offering voters perhaps anything *but* this simple take on an issue that was clearly front of mind for them. She ultimately seemed to arrive at [price gouging](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/16/business/harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation/index.html) as the main bogeyman at fault for inflation, not money printing. And that just didn't hold water for voters, ultimately.

In fairness, her campaign was also quick to point out that the 12-month rate of inflation has recently fallen [closer](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/u-s-inflation-drops-to-lowest-point-in-3-years-at-2-4-percent-some-price-pressures-remain) to the Federal Reserve's traditional target of 2% as an acceptable level of price increases. While this is undeniably true, there are a couple of important caveats that complicate the picture.

The first is that, as a dynamic measure of change, akin to acceleration in physics, a lower inflation rate doesn't necessarily mean the prices that voters see at the supermarket everyday are going *down* in absolute terms. *They're just going up more slowly.*

That likely helps explain why the recent "drop" in 12-month measures of inflation hasn't done much to blunt voters' frustration at the *cumulative* inflation over the full term of the Biden administration. Looking at that bigger picture, Forbes recently [estimated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/11/01/how-the-economy-really-fared-under-bidenharris-and-trump-from-jobs-to-inflation-final-update/) the 45-month change in U.S. consumer prices during Biden's term so far at 20.1%.

Yikes.

By not linking inflation and money printing explicitly, Harris also effectively abandoned a major argument that could have been useful in her favor: The pandemic -- and thus the easy money policies related to it -- in fact started [during Trump's first term](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-house-vote/index.html).

Thus whatever inflation resulted was demonstrably not the sole fault of the Biden-Harris administration. Blame for it should really be shared by both parties. But that's not the impression the voting public got as Trump was able to pin inflation entirely on Democrats during the campaign.

Meanwhile, Harris prattled on about... price gouging. Great.

Politically, it's now too late for the vice president, of course. But if any congressional Democrats are reading this article, please be on alert: You may yet get a second chance to properly pin inflation on Trump in the new term.

His proposed policies of wide-randing tariffs, tax cuts, and (implicitly) big deficits beginning next year could be [a perfect recipe](https://time.com/7095898/donald-trump-economy-plan-2024/) for a resurgence in inflation. Coincidentally, these proposals come at a time when the Fed has begun [cutting interest rates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/fed-rate-decision-november-2024.html) as well. So everyone in Washington will truly be doing their part to chip in.

God help us.
