Some tech-focused and (mostly) nonpartisan notes on the U.S. election:

Marcotte: American voters are swimming in a sea of ignorance, much of it in the form of online misinformation. https://www.salon.com/2024/11/08/americas-political-discordance-the-want-progressivism/

### FIT21 probably passes.

### But we better make it count.

There won't be a second bite at the legislative apple. Also notable: There probably won't be anything done on AI.

Vox on how Trump 2nd term will be different. <!-- Need YouTube link -->

### Gary Gensler is out.

### Inflation -- and the "everything rally" in asset markets -- will be back.

### At best, Trump does nothing to solve crypto's biggest PR problem. He could even make it worse.

### Crypto has lost the moral high ground

Most of the money is going to Republicans because, as I've often noted in the newsletter, the industry is irate over federal regulators' open hostility to crypto under President Biden. Back in February, I specifically predicted there could be a [round of political payback](https://peteramckay.medium.com/bitcoiners-strike-back-at-warren-da0603bfc1f9) in the form of donations as November neared.

And so here we are, on the eve of the election. Frankly, although I agree the Securities and Exchange Commission has [overreached](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/whats-stake-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-case-against-sec-2023-08-29/) against crypto in many ways, I am not at all sold on the idea, popular among some celebrity entrepreneur types right now, that Donald Trump is the solution the industry needs right now.

Three reasons why I say that:

1. **Trump's legal woes, including TKTK convictions on business fraud,** are bad PR that the industry really doesn't need right now. Among the general public, we're still suffering from association with the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried. Like a lot of people reading this newsletter, I don't believe that perception is substantively true. But it would be a really good idea for us to *show* the public it's not true by shunning proven fraudsters from other industries, including Trump.

- The Fed's money printing will continue.

- An American CBDC seems less likely. Powell doesn't seem keen on the idea, and if Congress passes regulation of privately issued stablecoins, will there really be a market need for an "official" one?

- Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech will continue. In my opinion, this is underrated as a positive for people building producsts for a decentralized internet. Curtailing the monopolistic practices of the web2 companies should create new opportunities.


- We've made this partisan. That dynamic won't go away easily.

- Becoming more effective at Washington's inherently evil donor game isn't necessarily a good thing. probably inconsistent with the blockchain community's core values of decentralization.

- Crypto's post-FTX PR problem remains unresolved.

- The reign of bitcoin as king has been solidified. It's not a security.


- We're going to get more tied to Wall Street.

- Web3 is a vehicle for global collaboration, better than government or diplomacy.

- To heal the U.S., fix the dollar.













5 things politicians are getting wrong about crypto

- No, it's not all a scam.
- No, it's not going to just go away.
- The difference between network protocols and companies built on top of them.
- The flaws in their own dollar-based system.
- The causes of inflation.
