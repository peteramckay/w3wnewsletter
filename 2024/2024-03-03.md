**The $100 bill** is now America's most popular cash denomination, with more of them in circulation than even the venerable $1 note bearing George Washington's likeness.

So says the Wall Street Journal's Oyin Adedoyin in a [recent story](https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/american-dollar-currency-100-bill-c6a47c79?st=02dgeljm8vby6zg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about the [c-note](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/c-note.asp)'s meteoric rise. Adedoyin reports that more than half the supply of $100 bills is held abroad, and there are enough $100 bills circulating in the U.S. for every living citizen to have 55 of them.

If you're not sitting on such a trove of large bills, or perhaps have never even *seen* such a stack of [simoleons](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simoleon) in your entire life, it won't surprise you to hear the Journal also reports much of the supply of $100 bills seems to be going toward illegal activity.

You think?

For purposes of this newsletter, the $100 bill story strikes me as important context for any discussion of crime conducted via cryptocurrency -- a frequent criticism of the technology itself.

Of course, any amount of crypto-funded crime is bad. Let's get that out of the way. It is still *crime*, after all. I'm just saying, let's maintain some sense of proportion about it, especially relative to crime conducted with old-fashioned paper issued by Uncle Sam.

Any reasonable reading of the numbers would suggest the latter is vastly larger. It's difficult to measure crime precisely, of course, as drug dealers, terrorists, and the like tend not to fill out surveys. But we can make some educated guesses looking at macro data.

The research firm Chainalysis recently [estimated](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/) there was $24.2 billion in illegal crypto activity worldwide in 2023. But that's really just an initial estimate, subject to go up quite a bit over time as analysts identify more on-chain wallets associated with criminals.

For argument's sake, let's say the 2023 crypto crime tally more than doubles over time to $50 billion, once Chainalysis has fuller data in hand.

Now let's get back to that mushrooming pile of paper Benjamins. According to the chart accompanying the Journal article, there are now more than $1.75 *trillion* worth of $100 bills in circulation.

That means our (purposefully high) estimate of crypto crime is less than 3% the supply of $100 bills.

Now, what percentage of those bills do you think are being used in crime? I'll let you make your own assumption about that part. But let it suffice that many of you will probably place the figure multiple times higher than 3%.

# Week in Review

- **The rally in token prices accelerated,** pushing major market indicators within reach of all-time records set in November 2021. Bitcoin led the way, jumping 22% for the week to top $60,000 per token. It was helped by growing anticipation of a [network "halving" next month](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-bitcoins-upcoming-halving-differs-from-the-cryptos-previous-cycles-6813e4a4), which would [tighten bitcoin supply](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/02/22/crypto-for-advisors-bitcoins-4th-halving-is-approaching/). The token's price is now within 11% of its all-time high. The broader crypto market's valuation, which now stands at $2.4 trillion, is 27% from its record.

- **Ethereum developers wrap up their annual Denver conference today.** Many of the gathering's major panels and keynote speeches are viewable on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ETHDenver). Full schedule and other conference details are available on ETH Denver's official site [here](https://www.ethdenver.com/).

- **Ten Wall Street firms,** including BlackRock and Fidelity, have [submitted proposals](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/bitcoin-etfs-ether-investing-cryptocurrency-8d2f4d55) to U.S. regulators to offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding ether. Such listings would be similar financially to the bitcoin ETFs approved and launched in January. But from a governance standpoint, S&P Global analysts [warned](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/240220-u-s-ether-etfs-could-exacerbate-concentration-risk-13009237) that ether ETFs could throw a wrench in the Ethereum network's staking mechanism by concentrating too much power with the fund issuers on Wall Street.

- **Reddit's IPO filing** revealed that the social platform holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, and Polygon's MATIC tokens as part of its corporate treasury and to make payments. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/02/23/what-reddits-ipo-filing-says-about-crypto-regulation/))

- **Lens Protocol,** a platform for putting social data on-chain, has gone permissionless. Users can now participate in the network by creating a non-fungible token for their profile. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/279335/blockchain-based-social-graph-lens-enters-permissionless-phase))

- **Venture funding of U.S. startups with Black founders** fell 71% in 2023, greatly outpacing the industrywide 37% decline in startup funding. Investment in Black founders totaled just $705 million, the lowest figure since 2016, according to a 2-part series by Crunchbase News. The first installment is [here](https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/venture-funding-black-founded-startups-2023-data/), and the second is [here](https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/black-founder-startup-investment-bay-area-atlanta-boston-data/).

- **Apple canceled** its development of an electric car and will shift many of the engineers to AI projects instead. ([Engadget](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/the-apple-car-project-is-reportedly-dead/ar-BB1iZNdP))

- **Chipmaker Nvidia's valuation** has soared over $2 trillion thanks to the recent AI boom, raising the personal profile of founder and CEO Jensen Huang as well. But rivals and even customers are increasingly looking for alternatives to Nvidia's chips in order to keep the company's influence in check. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-vision-company-f05db212?st=uydjpbt6y2q0hqw&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

# Odds & Ends

- **The Center for Climate Integrity** says in a [new report](https://climateintegrity.org/plastics-fraud) that plastic recycling is "a public fraud" that "is not technically or economically viable at scale."

- **Does coffee have so many health benefits** that it qualifies as a "liquid vegetable?" The Washington Post [investigates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/27/coffee-diabetes-health-benefits/).
