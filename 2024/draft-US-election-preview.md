# How crypto will win (and lose) the U.S. election
## TKTKTKTK

**As the U.S. election approaches on Tuesday,** I want to share some implications I anticipate for web3.

In short, I see mostly upside for the industry no matter who wins the presidency. But there will also likely be some downsides that -- I repeat -- aren't necessarily dependent on the new administration.

In other words, I tend to think the presidency's importance is a bit overstated, especially in the mainstream press narrative that relentlessly conditions us to see U.S. politics 100% through a president-centered lens.

Meanwhile, the importance of Congress -- a branch of government co-equal to the presidency -- tends to get short shrift.

That's perhaps a framing the crypto industry in particular should avoid. I would argue that everything that has made crypto world livid about U.S. regulation the last few years -- a story usually told in terms of executive overreach -- is truly rooted in a glaring lack of congressional action *first.*

In other words, we can't just obsess over how the rules are applied day-to-day and overlook how they got written in the first place, and who does the writing. That's Congress.








while that of Congress -- a co-equal branch of government  doesn't matter as much you might think.
I realize it's counterintuitive to say  The mainstream press has relentlessly conditioned us to frame American politics through a 100% president-centered lens.

I think that frame is itself a pretty big mistake, though, for two reasons:

1. **Congress is a co-equal branch of government to the president** under the U.S. Constitution. Hence, who wins a majority in the House and Senate is just as crucial to achieving more favorable crypto policy in the U.S. as who wins the White House. In fact, I would argue that everything that has made the crypto industry absolutely livid about Washington the last few years -- a story usually told in terms of executive overreach -- is rooted in a lack of congressional action *first.*

2. **For the crypto industry in particular,** the defining narrative of this cycle has been a surge in campaign donations. The industry has thus effectively announced itself as a powerful new political interest group in Washington, on par with energy companies or conventional finance or other heavyweights. That has a way of getting access and influence at *both* ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, as they say in DC. In other words, both the White House *and* the capitol, where Congress meets. In some ways, the latter is even hungrier for campaign cash, since lawmakers' name recognition and fundraising clout tends not to be as great as presidential candidates.








I do care.

Frankly, I have very mixed feelings about this push. On the one hand, it will likely result in more favorable policies regardless of who wins the presidency and congressional majorities in a few weeks. We will either elect more crypto-friendly officheholders or else, at the very least, have sent a powerful message to the other side not to mess with crypto in the future.

One unrelated caveat: https://www.axios.com/2024/10/24/election-results-timing-vote-count


Most of the money is going to Republicans because, as I've often noted in the newsletter, the industry is irate over federal regulators' open hostility to crypto under President Biden. Back in February, I specifically predicted there could be a [round of political payback](https://peteramckay.medium.com/bitcoiners-strike-back-at-warren-da0603bfc1f9) in the form of donations as November neared.

And so here we are, on the eve of the election. Frankly, although I agree the Securities and Exchange Commission has [overreached](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/whats-stake-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-case-against-sec-2023-08-29/) against crypto in many ways, I am not at all sold on the idea, popular among some celebrity entrepreneur types right now, that Donald Trump is the solution the industry needs right now.

Three reasons why I say that:

1. **Trump's legal woes, including TKTK convictions on business fraud,** are bad PR that the industry really doesn't need right now. Among the general public, we're still suffering from association with the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried. Like a lot of people reading this newsletter, I don't believe that perception is substantively true. But it would be a really good idea for us to *show* the public it's not true by shunning proven fraudsters from other industries, including Trump.

2. **I don't take Trump at his word about his promise to be "the crypto president" -- or on anything else for that matter.** Refer back to Point 1. Trump has repeated shown that his nature is fundamentally that of a con man. He says whatever will make the person in front of him vote for him at any given moment. If it suits him, he'll also say 180 degrees the opposite to a different person, even if the first statement was on-camera. And, no, even if you generally ... His efforts to on abortion are absurd on their face. Even other Republicans on this year's down-ballot haven't been so utterly, ridiculously shameless.

3. **There are demonstrable reasons to believe a Harris administration would have a lighter touch than Biden's.** She's not 80, she represented California in the Senate previously, and is close to Silicon Valley.

5 ways web3 will win the U.S. election.

- Congress has figured out we're here to stay.
 
- Increased regulatory clarity seems more likely. Fit21, etc.

- The Fed's money printing will continue.

- An American CBDC seems less likely. Powell doesn't seem keen on the idea, and if Congress passes regulation of privately issued stablecoins, will there really be a market need for an "official" one?

- Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech will continue. In my opinion, this is underrated as a positive for people building producsts for a decentralized internet. Curtailing the monopolistic practices of the web2 companies should create new opportunities.

5 ways web3 will lose the U.S. election.

- We've made this partisan. That dynamic won't go away easily.

- Becoming more effective at Washington's inherently evil donor game isn't necessarily a good thing. probably inconsistent with the blockchain community's core values of decentralization.

- Crypto's post-FTX PR problem remains unresolved.

- The reign of bitcoin as king has been solidified. It's not a security.


- We're going to get more tied to Wall Street.
