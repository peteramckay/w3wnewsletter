**If you're subscribed to a tech newsletter like this,** I assume there's a decent chance you're a fan of Star Wars. Some people might be exceptions, of course, but the odds are ever in my favor, to borrow a phrase from a [certain other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s7qgNMqDJI) sci-fi franchise.

Thus I won't consider it off-topic to call your attention to [my latest Medium post](https://medium.com/p/58cb09646481) in honor of the Saturday's May 4th "holiday" (aka Star Wars Day). It lays out my recommended ordering for watching live-action Star Wars content, including a curation of theatrical movies and streaming content.

While writing this one up, it struck me that we've entered something akin to an "open source" era for the Star Wars franchise, almost 40 years into its existence.

I don't mean that in terms of permissive licensing of the intellectual property, mind you. Lucasfilm and its parent Disney are still [cranky as ever](https://www.reuters.com/legal/lucasfilm-sues-star-wash-chilean-star-wars-themed-car-wash-2023-12-27/) about that.

But we have certainly reached a point where a fan can mix and match the existing Star Wars movies and shows in terms of your own consumption, perhaps more than any other sci-fi franchise ever. You can reassemble the myriad parts -- and leave out elements you don't like -- into something that's uniquely useful for you.

In fact, I would say that's the *only* sane way to approach Star Wars at this point, considering the sheer volume of content that's been added to the franchise's canon over the years.

[My Medium post](https://medium.com/p/58cb09646481) attempts to cut through all that interplanetary clutter. Enjoy.

On to some tech news from a galaxy not far, far away at all...

### Week in Review: April 28 to May 4, 2024

Waning hopes for a prompt interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve have hurt BTC and other speculative assets lately, [including U.S. stocks](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/s-p-500-falls-4-2-in-april-as-market-momentum-loses-steam-81466397). JPMorgan analysts said individual investors [led April's selling](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/02/crypto-market-sell-off-was-driven-by-retail-investors-jpmorgan-says/), but institutions have remained somewhat more bullish on crypto. One example: Jack Dorsey's payments company Block, formerly known as Square, said it will [continue to buy bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/02/jack-dorseys-block-adding-more-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-presents-road-map-for-others/) to for its corporate balance sheet.

Australian regulators are expected to approve bitcoin ETFs by the end of the year, according to [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-28/bitcoin-btc-etf-bandwagon-heads-to-australia-after-53-billion-haul-in-us).

- **Courtroom updates:** Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was [sentenced to four months](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-cz-sentenced-to-four-months-in-prison-.html) in prison in the U.S. for violations of anti-money laundering requirements at his crypto exchange. Separately, early bitcoin investor Roger Ver was [arrested in Spain](https://www.theblock.co/post/291772/early-bitcoin-investor-roger-ver-arrested-charged-with-alleged-tax-fraud) and charged with tax violations in the U.S.

- **The web3 publishing startup Paragraph** raised $5 million in new venture financing and announced its will acquire Mirror, an Ethereum-based blogging platform.

### Odds & Ends

- **You don't say!** ICYMI, a headline that actually ran on the New York Times website April 26: ["With Inflation This High, Nobody Knows What a Dollar Is Worth"](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/business/inflation-money-dollar-value.html)

- **Why can an iPhone survive a drop** from a plane but not from your kitchen counter? Through some creative use of drones, The Wall Street Journal [investigates](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/why-an-iphone-can-survive-a-drop-from-a-plane-but-not-from-your-kitchen-counter-57453ca9?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink).
