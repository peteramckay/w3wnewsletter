**In honor of Star Wars Day this May 4th,** I'd like to weigh in on a long-running debate that confounds newbies to the franchise and destroys friendships among the [Coruscant](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/star-wars-movies-in-order/) cognoscenti.

What is the best order in which to watch the Star Wars movies?

Conventionally, there are two schools of thought: Either watch them in order of real-life release starting with 1977's Episode IV: A New Hope, or watch them in order of the fictional narrative, which is a quite radically different experience.

Then there is the question of the two standalone live-action films, which don't carry "episode" numbers but are part of the same continuity, plus an ever-increasing body of [canonical](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_media) streaming shows, TV, animation, and other media. If you want to be complete, should you leave this stuff out? On the other hand, if you want to include it, do you start your May 4th watch party in January?

My own recommended order, listed below, tries to resolve all this in a reasonable way. It treats the 11 live-action movies, watched in narrative order, as the backbone. However, as a certain space pirate [might say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1WkXxWoGiI), I've made a lot of special modifications myself to that approach.

Frankly, the series includes some of the best sci-fi releases ever made and a few that are pure [bantha](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bantha) fodder. Thus I treat some of the movies as negotiable viewing, at best.  

I have also excluded more than 90% of the non-movie content, except for a few highlights that I believe are truly essential.

I'll avoid major spoilers as I go, although a few plot points are unavoidable to mention.

The net effect here may be to shorten your total viewing time, but that's not really my point. This  is the ordering that I think truly highlights the best aspects of the Star Wars franchise, will allow newcomers to understand why it's so beloved by existing fans, and at the same time acknowledge the sprawling, uneven nature of the space beast in question.

As a bonus, you may even pick up a second language. üòÅ

OK, let's get to the step-by-step:

### Skip Episodes I and II entirely.

Look, these movies suck mightily, life is short, and barely anything happens that's of importance to the rest of the narrative. Those few parts are more than adequately recapped in the famous [opening text "crawls"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t2MKB1_z1A) of subsequent Star Wars films. So just save yourself the time.

To be more specific: These movies, released in [1999](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace) and [2002](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_ii_attack_of_the_clones) respectively, begin what's called the Prequel Trilogy. They tell the backstory to the Original Trilogy that was released in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on the origin of Darth Vader.

As I see it, these movies' core problem is that a single character's origin should be a single movie. Then you show that character in other adventures, as the Marvel movies and  other franchises have demonstrated since the Prequel Trilogy was released. Heck, even the Star Wars series has done a standalone origin film since.

Thus Episodes I and II can safely be treated as filler.

In their defense, action fans will rightly point out that these two movies contain some of the best choreographed light saber fights in the whole series. If you're curious, you can view these on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo__6MZIg6U) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg1ydN42ukY) in under eight minutes.

Even without context, it will be glaringly obvious who the good guys and bad guys are. And if you sat through the full four hours-plus of these movies, all their gibberish wouldn't add much to your understanding anyway. Trust me.

### Watch Episode III: Revenge of the Sith -- in Spanish.

This is the movie where Darth Vader finally becomes cinema's most famous respiratory patient, complete with that mean streak we all love to hate. It still suffers from many of the other prequels' flaws, notably dialogue that's somehow both clunkily written and melodramatically delivered. But Vader's final transformation is certainly worth the watch.

In a retrospective for the 10-year anniversary of "Sith," Salon's Nico Lang [wrote](https://www.salon.com/2015/12/17/not_all_the_star_wars_prequels_suck_revisiting_revenge_of_the_sith_the_most_tragically_underrated_episode/):

*If Roger Ebert compared the original trilogy to a space opera, ‚ÄúRevenge of the Sith‚Äù is akin to a delicious space telenovela, and the script makes a lot more sense if you imagine the words being dubbed for the actors as they speak. ‚ÄúRevenge of the Sith‚Äù might only be the third- or fourth-best ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù film (depending on your feelings about ewoks), but it would be the greatest Telemundo show ever made.*

This strikes me as a 100% apt, very succinct summary of "Sith," to the point I think we should take Lang's advice to its logical conclusion. Turn on the Spanish audio on whatever home video version of Sith that you're watching, turn on the subtitles in another language if you need them, and get the full space telenovela experience. Why not?

### Watch Solo. Go on. Just do it.

Next up in the narrative chronology is this 2018 origin story of Han Solo, a fan favorite character first played in 1977 by Harrison Ford, in the role that made him a movie star. In the origin film, Alden Ehrenreich plays a younger version of the master smuggler in the making.

Unfortunately, a lot of old-school fans couldn't accept the re-casting of Ford and sat out Solo's theatrical release in 2018, making it the [lowest-grossing](https://www.looper.com/1393489/why-solo-flopped-box-office-how-changed-star-wars-forever/) Star Wars movie to date. But if you can approach the movie without such hangups, it really is an entertaining adventure.

Solo sits squarely in the swashbuckling tradition of the old Flash Gordon serials that [inspired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAGBz1MiEJs&pp=ygUdJ2ZsYXNoIGdvcmRvbicgJ2dlb3JnZSBsdWNhcyc%3D) Star Wars creator George Lucas as a kid. Throw in some more modern flourishes from director Ron Howard, and you have a solid formula for an enjoyable movie.

### Watch Andor Season 1.

This gritty 10-episode run is my first pick among the Disney+ shows in the Star Wars universe. It further explores the origins of both the evil Galactic Empire and the Rebellion through the eyes of people on the front lines. There are no space wizards and magic here, just people trying to determine where they fit in and save their own necks. It's awesome.

### Watch Rogue One.

This standalone film continues very much in the vain of Andor, including an appearance by the title character of the streaming series.

We also meet Jyn Erso, whose father, an engineer, has been conscripted by the Empire to design a planet-destroying battle station called the Death Star. A hastily assembled team of rebels then attempts to steal the plans for the new weapon, in a daring effort to protect the galaxy from it.

Think of this one as the Star Wars universe's version of [The Dirty Dozen](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_dozen), a World War II classic. Its ending also perfectly sets up the next step...

### Watch Episodes IV to VI (aka the Original Trilogy) in order of release.

At last, we've come to it. These movies, released from 1977 to 1983, are the bedrock of the entire Star Wars franchise. The ones that made it a multibillion-dollar juggernaut at the box office in the first place.

The probably isn't much new I can say that hasn't already been written about these installments about the rebels' fight against galactic tyranny, now led by Vader's son Luke Skywalker.

Let it suffice that the trilogy builds to climactic battles in Episode VI: Return of the Jedi for both the galactic war in general and the Skywalker family in particular. The execution of this is so solid, to the point of all these movies being classics, that everything that follows in the narrative could be considered optional viewing, in my opinion.

To parahrase many a Jedi master, I would advise you at this point to search your feelings. If you're satisfied with how Return of the Jedi ends and want to stop there, please do, without guilt.

If you're curious to continue on, that's also OK. My advice on how best to do that follows, with some crucial caveats.

### If you really, really feel you need an epilogue to the Original Trilogy, and if you don't mind delving into another serial Disney+ series, watch the first two seasons of the Mandalorian.

Essentially a space Western about the chaotic aftermath of the Original Trilogy's events. There is now a New Republic in power, trying to solidify its power across the galaxy. Remnants of the Empire remain as well, now working in the shadows to re-establish their rule. And a bounty hunter who belongs to the warrior Mandalorian tribe gets caught in the middle when he unexpectedly rescues an alien child during the course of a job.

There are a lot of unexpected twists and pathos to this one. And if you stop at the end of Season 2, the ties back to the films couldn't be clearer. (There is also a Season 3 that exists and is OK, by the way. But it's not as directly relevant to the movies.)

### If you really, really, really feel you need an epilogue to *that* story, or if you want an epilogue to the Original Trilogy but weren't willing to commit to a TV series, watch Episode VII.

Here we get back to the theatrical movies -- and into some even heavier caveats.

Disney, which now owns the Star Wars franchise, decided to launch a new trilogy of main "episode" movies in 2015. Ostensibly, these are supposed to build upon the resolution in Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.

As a three-movie arc, known to hardcore fans as the Sequel Trilogy, Episodes VII through IX fail miserably at that goal, in my opinion. But the first installment, Episode VII: The Force Awakens, is easily the best of the bunch. In fact, it's the only one rated "fresh" by both critics and the audience [on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens), if you follow such things.

The action takes place 30 years after the fall of the Galactic Empire. An evil faction calling itself the New Order is trying to take over, and a new rag-tag Resistance is forming against it. A desert scavenger named Rey gets caught up in the struggle and, along the way, discovers she has a mysterious connection to the universe's karmic energy known as the Force.

You might notice, the story beats here are pretty similar to 1977, to the point that Force Awakens could essentially be considered a remake of that year's Episode IV: A New Hope. If you take it in that spirit, and are willing to treat it as a standalone adventure, I think it's a fun watch.

Hardcore fans may protest that the movie ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, which I won't spoil here. But I will say, if you're willing to let that cliffhanger sit unresolved for eternity, Force Awakens could serve as a rather poetic end to a person's overall Star Wars-watching experience. Think about it.

Then there's the other option to consider...

### If you are the kind of person who leaves a few tablespoons of milk or orange juice in a gallon container in the refrigerator for your partner to discover later, then watch Episode VIII and, God help you, Episode IX. By all means.

If it's not clear, I'm really going to recommend against watching these last two installments. For me, they are in a similar category as Episodes I and II -- essentially unwatchable.

That said, because they're at the *end* of the overall Star Wars narrative on film, not the beginning, some people might find them harder to skip. I mean, if you've gotten this far, why *not* go all the way to the end? It's tempting logic, I know.

My answer: Because major plotlines introduced in Episode VII ultimately lead nowhere. One writer or director clearly tries at certain points to undo something they didn't like that another did in the previous movie. And so on.

The further you go with the Sequel Trilogy, the more you realize: It isn't a saga at all; it's just a mishmash.

In that sense, Episode IX is several notches worse than VIII. But really, just save yourself the headache of either of them.

As Luke Skywalker himself warns at one point in VIII: "This isn't going to end how you think."

He was right about that, in a very bad way.
