**Let's be honest.** Geeks rank high on the list of people who can be difficult to shop for around the holidays.

If you're facing that conundrum right now, why not give the gift of a paid w3w subscription on Substack? We offer discounted gift subs for either [individuals](https://w3wnews.substack.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fw3wnews.substack.com%2F&gift=true) or [groups](https://w3wnews.substack.com/subscribe?simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fw3wnews.substack.com%2F&group=true), if you want to buy for several colleagues or employees at a time.

With a paid subscription, your friends and loved ones will enjoy full access to w3w, including the newsletter's complete archive, commenting access, and our subscriber-only webinars.

Of course, you'll also be helping them stay abreast of the latest on Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI, and other emerging technologies throughout 2025.
