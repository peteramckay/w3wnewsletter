**Exchange-traded funds** that allow U.S. investors to buy and sell bitcoin via their conventional accounts with stockbrokers have unquestionably been a big hit since gaining regulatory approval in January. <!-- Find, add link... -->

Now Wall Street is exploring other crypto-related offerings, hoping that customers' appetite for the bitcoin ETF may translate into other products as well.

Firms are proposing new instruments that either integrate blockchain technology directly or, like the bitcoin ETFs, enable bets on the direction of token prices. But there are early signs that some of these products could also face resistance from the public, regulators, or certain corners of the financial industry itself in the months ahead.

- **Meta's experiments** in augmented and virtual reality have lost $40 billion since the company changed its name from Facebook. However, the company still posted record profits in its latest quarterly reports due to income from a more familiar source -- selling ads against user-generated content on its social platforms.
