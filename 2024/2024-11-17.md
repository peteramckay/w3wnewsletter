<!-- 100-word intro -->

**Donald Trump will not officially become U.S. president** until he is sworn in at noon Jan. 20 in Washington. But don't bother telling the crypto industry that.

A delirious celebration has already ensued since Trump's election win earlier this month, especially among token investors anticipating friendlier policies from the man who promised during the recent campaign to be America's first "crypto president."

Bitcoin leapt nearly 20% last week to [hit a new all-time high](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoins-price-run-continues-above-usd93-000-8744424) above $93,000 per token on Wednesday. That helped push the broader token market's global valuation above $3 trillion -- a new record as well, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/) data.

Other developments to watch as America's presidential transition plays out through the New Year:

- **When will Gensler go?** Remarks by Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler in a speech at a conference Thursday sparked speculation that his [resignation may be imminent](https://decrypt.co/291834/gary-gensler-sec-chair-been-proud-to-serve). Gensler said he's "been proud to serve" at the SEC, using the past tense. Trump vowed during the campaign to fire Gensler, who's waged an aggressive crackdown on crypto companies.

- **Reuters reports** that the Justice Deparment is poised to shift resources [away from crypto enforcement](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crypto-enforcement-seen-slowing-as-trump-shifts-priorities/ar-AA1uaaya) to immigration cases under the new administration.

- **A full breakup of Google now seems less likely.** Trump will probably [let pending antitrust cases continue](https://www.fastcompany.com/91223853/trump-win-google-antitrust-cases) against several Big Tech companies. But he's publicly been averse to one of the most dreaded options under consideration in the penalty phase of a case Google has already lost to the Justice Department.

- **Inflation could yet rear its head.** One of the few [speed bumps](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-corrects-as-us-inflation-data-emerges-is-the-rally-to-100k-at-stake) in the post-election crypto rally so far was the release of new data showing [an uptick](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/257272/us-inflation-rises-fed-rate-cut-still-expected-in-december.aspx) in U.S. inflation in October. If that trend continues, perhaps pushed along by Trump's proposal to [impose widespread tariffs](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/nobel-economists-trump-inflation/index.html), it could yet put a damper on riskier assets like stocks and crypto.

On to some notable headlines elsewhere:
