**MicroStrategy's stunning bitcoin-fueled rise** hit a new milestone as Nasdaq announced the company will be [added to its Nasdaq 100 index](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/12/microstrategy-to-enter-nasdaq-100-exposing-bitcoin-linked-stock-to-billions-in-passive-investment-flows) effective Dec. 23.

As it happens, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor also recently dropped by [Scott Galloway's podcast](https://podbay.fm/p/prof-g-markets/e/1733389200) to discuss his decision in 2020 to begin investing MicroStrategy's corporate cash reserves in bitcoin.

Over time, that decision has wildly boosted [MicroStrategy's stock price](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/MSTR:NASDAQ?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjivI3Q4qqKAxWDC3kGHY2fEG4Q3ecFegQIRRAf&window=5Y), up almost thirtyfold since the start of 2020. It's also effectively transformed the company from an old-school tech conslultancy into a $98 billion behemoth that now derives most of its value from its crypto-heavy balance sheet.

Over the last few years, Saylor has also become one of the most publicly outspoken bitcoin cheerleaders around. So he's hardly a stranger to press interviews on the topic.

That said, I would say that Galloway, a venture investor himself who's also an author and a professor at New York University's business school, goes into a remarkably detailed exploration of Saylor's decisions around bitcoin. You get way more nitty-gritty in the "Prof G Markets" [podcast episode](https://podbay.fm/p/prof-g-markets/e/1733389200) than when Saylor does a 90-second "hit" on CNBC, for example.

It also helps that Galloway's co-host Ed Elson asks a lot of appropriately skeptical questions in the episode about risks and potential downsides of corporate bitcoin holdings, always in context of how such an approach compares to more traditional financial management.

For now, most companies outside the crypto space clearly share Elson's skittishness about bitcoin. An overwhelming majority of Microsoft shareholders recently [voted down a proposal](https://decrypt.co/296145/less-than-1-of-microsoft-shareholders-voted-in-favor-of-investing-in-bitcoin) to do so, for instance.

But the question is definitely getting harder to ignore, at least. A 30x rise in any public company's share price is inevitably going to get other CEOs wondering whether they should emulate whatever those other guys did.

Up next: Amazon shareholders will [vote on a proposal](https://www.benzinga.com/24/12/42382133/amazon-shareholders-propose-adding-bitcoin-to-treasury-for-best-long-term-interest-cite-microstrategy-as-example) similar to Microsoft's in April.

### Odds & Ends

- **NASA's Mars drone Ingenuity** suffered [an abrupt end](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/13/ingenuity_mars_helicopters_flying_days/) to its mission after apparently suffering rotor damage during its 72nd flight.

Engineers had expected it to last only five flights.

- **Scientists have discovered a new microorganism** that they've dubbed "Conan the Bacterium" because it can withstand radiation strong enough to kill a human. The microscopic critter may prove useful for protecting humans during long-duration space travel. ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/science/conan-the-bacterium-antioxidant/index.html))
