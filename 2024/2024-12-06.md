# Some bitcon lessons worth repeating...
### Of the many strong opinions on offer in the press right now about bitcoin's run to $100,000, some will inevitably be proven wildly wrong. Perhaps even your own.

*<strong>In recognition of bitcoin finally crossing the $100,000 per token milestone</strong>, I‚Äôm writing to you a little earlier than usual this week. I‚Äôve already had a few ‚Äúnormie‚Äù friends who aren‚Äôt in the crypto industry ask me about the new bitcoin record ‚Äî a phenomenon that always gives me pause, to be honest. So I‚Äôve been thinking about the news largely through that lens.*

*For the record, [CoinDesk reports](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/12/05/bitcoin-at-100-k-industry-reaction) that the first official six-figure bitcoin transaction was confirmed on-chain early Thursday UTC. But your local time may vary, of course. For me in New York, it happened Wednesday night.*

*At any rate, on to the burning questions my non-geek friends and family usually ask whenever there‚Äôs a new all-time record in bitcoin:*

*Is it too late to buy? Have I missed the rally? Or does it have further upside yet to come?*

*In person, I will admit I still freeze up a little when I‚Äôm asked this, as I believe investment advice should be highly individualized. If someone asks me this, it‚Äôs not really just a question about the bitcoin chart. It‚Äôs also a tacit, deceptively complex question about that person as an investor, what other assets they own, how bitcoin might fit into that portfolio, the person‚Äôs age, psychological risk tolerance, and so forth.*

*All the more reason why I don‚Äôt seek to offer investment advice in the w3w newsletter. It‚Äôs written for several thousand people a week, not you as an individual. (Sorry!) To the extent I discuss markets in the newsletter, that content is always meant as a starting point to educate yourself, perhaps ask further (but hopefully better informed) questions of a financial pro, and then arrive at the best decision for you as an individual.*

*All of that said, full disclosure: I do own a little bitcoin myself. In terms of the price chart, yes, I do believe it will continue to go up over the long term. (Key qualifier.) But I would also say the conversation should never really end there, which is why I write a friggin‚Äô newsletter that goes out with new information about this stuff on a regular basis.*

*In that spirit, copied below is a post I did back in the spring, the last time bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high. I‚Äôm re-sharing now for two reasons.*

*First, the readership of w3w is significantly larger now. So a lot of you certainly missed this one the first time.*

*Second, I believe the ideas in this post still hold up really well. They apply to bitcoin records, period, not some particular price quote.*

*Which brings me to one small caveat I must admit: The numbers below are all dated ‚Äî and much bigger now. I stand by everything else, though.* üòä

**Everyone is flat wrong about bitcoin at some point.** The real question is whether a person admits it and adjusts accordingly, or do they just keep doubling down either rhetorically or (God forbid) by betting real money.

It's possible to be wrong in either direction for prices, by the way. Given bitcoin's long-term strength, it's a way more common mistake to be too bearish. Early on, I was even [guilty of this myself](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/) covering markets for Vice News, lo those two crypto winters ago.

But being too bullish is also certainly possible in some cases, including many predictions with specific short-term timeframes and specific, astronomical price targets that have turned out to be [demonstrably wrong](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/05/02/balaji-srinivasan-concedes-bet-that-bitcoin-will-reach-1-million-in-90-days/).

This is all front of mind right now because bitcoin touched fresh [all-time highs](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/bitcoin-rises-record-high-over-70000-2024-03-08/) above $70,000 last week. Heading into Monday's trading, the token is still just a hair shy of that milestone and now carries a market capitalization near $1.4 trillion -- a valuation roughly equivalent to [all the world's silver](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Bitcoin-market-cap-approaches-silver-with-latest-rally).

In telling the story of this historic rally, the press has offered some interesting examples of past bitcoin market calls that didn't work out -- and how the issuers of those calls have responded.

Clearly in the "make adjustments as needed" school is Larry Fink, CEO of the giant hedge fund BlackRock Investments. The Wall Street Journal just published [a story](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/how-bitcoin-made-a-believer-out-of-blackrock-abebb140?st=971uegs09wu0qk8&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about how Fink went from being a staunch bitcoin skeptic in 2017 to jumping in with both feet.

Most important, he pushed BlackRock to offer what has become Wall Street's most popular exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding bitcoin on investors' behalf. In just the first few months of trading, BlackRock's fund has reportedly acquired [almost 200,000 BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-nears-200k-125311082.html), about $14 billion worth.

The Journal notes BlackRock has begun dabbling in other corners of the token market as  well. The firm has invested in stablecoin issuer Circle, partnered with Coinbase, and proposed an ether ETF to follow up on the bitcoin funds' success.

Unfortunately, in the "double down no matter what" school of thought regarding busted bitcoin calls is Gilad Edelman, a senior editor at The Atlantic. In a [new essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/crypto-bitcoin-market-strength/677643/) published Tuesday, he attempted to explain "why crypto just won't die."

I'll let you click through to read [the whole trainwreck](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/crypto-bitcoin-market-strength/677643/) for yourself, if you dare. But let it suffice that Edelman essentially goes through a bunch of contortions to continue to believe what he previously believed about crypto anyway, despite a ton of new information to the contrary.

A few possible explanations for crypto's survival that he somehow never considers include:

- Entrepreneurs are still building new services and products on top of open networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum in particular, trying to create real value for users. Because not everyone is Sam Bankman-Fried. In fact, the vast majority aren't.

- At the previous peak in late 2021, the global crypto market was worth $3 trillion. At the post-crash lows a little over a year later, it was still worth *about $800 billion*. That's what "dead" supposedly looks like? Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that, even in crypto's worst days, even after a ton of market value had indeed been destroyed, there was still a quite viable foundation to build a comeback upon. It was hiding in plain sight all along, dude.

- Maybe Edelman and his colleagues (gasp!) simply missed a few important things about the last market cycle.

But hey. What can you do about that last one? Happens to everyone sometimes, right?
