**The latest headlines** about emerging technologies, trends, and ideas transforming the web:

- **Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin proposed big changes** to the network in a [new blog post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/10/14/futures1.html), including lowered barriers for staking and faster confirmations for on-chain transactions. Buterin's proposals all seek to [build upon](https://decrypt.co/286233/ethereum-creator-vitalik-buterin-huge-changes) the major upgrade two years ago known as The Merge. They also come at a time when some members of Ethereum's open-source community are [concerned](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/10/11/has-ethereum-lost-its-way/) it is losing ground as a decentralized app platform to Solana and other rivals.

- **Andreessen Horowitz released** the 2024 edition of its annual State of Crypto [report](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2024/). The firm estimates there are now about [617 million crypto owners](https://qz.com/crypto-activity-has-soared-report-by-andreessen-horowit-1851674421) globally. But only 5-10% are active on a monthly basis, suggesting a major opportunity for platforms and companies to re-engage with past users who have gone dormant.

- **Web3 startups raised $2 billion** across 300-plus deals in the third quarter, up 43% from the year-ago period.

On Wall Street, the stock market rose [for a sixth straight week](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/17/stock-market-today-live-updates.html), including fresh records in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Friday's close. But gold also [hit a new record](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-touches-new-high-to-hold-above-2700-per-ounce-172934670.html) above $2,700 per troy ounce in New York -- traditionally a sign that some investors are concerned about potential economic turbulence ahead.

- **North America's role as a bitcoin hub** has [grown in 2024](https://news.google.com/read/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNUGVqRzkxX2VMV1lJOGhPZEtrOGU5cGdZMVJLMVUxbnVfY1hJN3FRaHhSbXdkcl9XTEJrZHFSS3VRMW82S2ZyQ1JqYnlXbzd0cE9TdmFDYTlhTGNmZ0kwbzBkelZYd1JrY1BSamludFl6TnZGWEdCdkR4Nk5HcUlGY0pMbVRFcGRzSnVMWUtvNUZGT096OHlPdWJNUnVvWXo4c1Vackg1RU9sY0ZrU1duTVhfTDNRYnNMVDlRMlptZEZzekZ0Qk5Gd3daN0V2MFktbnY4dg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) thanks to Wall Street's launch of exchange-traded funds holding BTC on investors' behalf. Excluding Mexico, the continent now makes up 22.5% of global crypto activity, with an estimated $1.3 trillion in on-chain value, according to this year‚Äôs ‚ÄúGeography of Cryptocurrency‚Äù [report](https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-2023-geography-of-cryptocurrency-report-release.pdf) from Chainalysis.

But the Wall Street Journal reports [Polymarket is investigating](https://www.wsj.com/finance/betting-election-pro-trump-ad74aa71?st=dJX1Td&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) a flurry of activity from just four accounts that may have skewed the broader market in Trump's favor.

In fact, approval came the next day... **The Ethereum restaking protocol EigenLayer** confirmed it [suffered a similar hack](https://decrypt.co/287159/eigenlayer-twitter-hack-airdrop-scam) Friday in which someone used its official Twitter/X account to promote an airdrop scam... **The U.S. Justice Department indicted** former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding and 15 other defendents for allegedly running a multi-billion dollar [international cocaine-trafficking ring](https://decrypt.co/287204/olympic-snowboarder-tether-cocaine-murders) that used Tether to launder money.
