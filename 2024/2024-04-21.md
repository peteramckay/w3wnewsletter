**What a study in contrasts.**

A foul mood spread around Wall Street last week regarding when exactly the Federal Reserve will start printing cheap dollars again. The U.S. central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell, said it [may take longer](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/business/chair-powell-discussion/index.html) than previously expected due to [persistently strong readings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/10/cpi-inflation-march-2024-consumer-prices-rose-3point5percent-from-a-year-ago-in-march.html) of inflation in America.

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network just slowed its money printer, predictably and transparently, right on schedule. No shock to it whatsoever.

I refer of course to Bitcoin's [latest halving](https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-2024-what-next-8636072), an event that happens approximately every four years and effectively limits issuance of new tokens on the network. The network just underwent a halving Friday evening, Eastern U.S. time, in accordance with the network's code.

For people speculating on bitcoin's token price, halvings tend to be welcome events. The additional constraint on supply has historically tended to boost bitcoin's market price across the three previous halvings in 2020, 2016, and 2012, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/crypto-fans-count-down-bitcoins-halving-2024-04-19/).

But Friday's halving was well-timed purely for educational purposes as well. For anyone who just wants to better understand what makes this "weird" new form of money different, and why it might be a necessary addition to global markets, the juxtaposition of this halving and the latest Fed drama within a few days of each other should be instructive.

A quick multiple-choice exercise that underscores the point: If you had to manage a global currency in the twenty-first century, would it make more sense to:

*A.* Automate the currency's issuance according to measurable milestones, based on publicly available data that's updated around the clock, seven days a week? Or...

*B.* Rely on the whims of a [small committee](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm) of human beings who [meet periodically](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) in secret, try to correctly guess the exact timing when the immensely complex global economy warrants a change in monetary policy, and then emerge to announce their decisions publicly, like [oracles](https://historycooperative.org/the-oracle-of-delphi/) from ancient times?

Extra credit question: Which of these options really seems "weirder" to you?

On to the week's other notable headlines...

### Week in Review: April 14-20, 2024

- **Bitcoin dominance,** a measure of the token's share of the global crypto market, touched a [three-year high](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/police-arrest-six-seek-three-others-linked-canadas-largest-gold-heist-2024-04-17/) above 56% ahead of the halving. It has since retreated somewhat, hovering below 54% in today's trading.

- **An Indian citizen** pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of defrauding Coinbase users of $9.5 million via a website that spoofed the exchange. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/19/indian-man-pleads-guilty-to-creating-spoofed-coinbase-website-stealing-95m-in-crypto/))

- **The U.S. Copyright Office** granted author Elisa Shupe a copyright on a self-published novel written with significant help from ChatGPT, in a case that could set a precedent for other AI-assisted works. The copyright was granted, with some caveats that USCO doesn't apply to books written the traditional way, after Shupe appealed an initial rejection. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-copyright-office-loosens-up-a-little-on-ai/))  

- **Apple says the Chinese government** ordered it to remove WhatsApp and Threads from its App Store in China due to unspecified national security concerns. Two other encrypted messaging apps, Signal and Telegram, also appear to have been taken down. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-removes-whatsapp-threads-china-app-store-wsj-reports-2024-04-19/))

- **Four of the U.S. tech behemoths** in the "Magnificent 7" are due to report quarterly earnings this week.

### Odds & Ends

- **Police arrested six people** and are looking for three more in connection with the largest gold heist in Canadian history. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/police-arrest-six-seek-three-others-linked-canadas-largest-gold-heist-2024-04-17/))

- **U.S. climate scientists announced** that the worldâ€™s coral reefs are undergoing a bleaching event caused by elevated ocean temperatures. Bleachings kill off symbiotic algae the corals need to survive. Yikes. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/15/climate/coral-reefs-bleaching.html))
