# Why you shouldn't care which candidate wins the U.S. presidency.

I do care.

<!--

Frankly, I have very mixed feelings about this push. On the one hand, it will likely result in more favorable policies regardless of who wins the presidency and congressional majorities in a few weeks. We will either elect more crypto-friendly officheholders or else, at the very least, have sent a powerful message to the other side not to mess with crypto in the future.

One unrelated caveat: https://www.axios.com/2024/10/24/election-results-timing-vote-count


Most of the money is going to Republicans because, as I've often noted in the newsletter, the industry is irate over federal regulators' open hostility to crypto under President Biden. Back in February, I specifically predicted there could be a [round of political payback](https://peteramckay.medium.com/bitcoiners-strike-back-at-warren-da0603bfc1f9) in the form of donations as November neared.

And so here we are, on the eve of the election. Frankly, although I agree the Securities and Exchange Commission has [overreached](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/whats-stake-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-case-against-sec-2023-08-29/) against crypto in many ways, I am not at all sold on the idea, popular among some celebrity entrepreneur types right now, that Donald Trump is the solution the industry needs right now.

Three reasons why I say that:

1. **Trump's legal woes, including TKTK convictions on business fraud,** are bad PR that the industry really doesn't need right now. Among the general public, we're still suffering from association with the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried. Like a lot of people reading this newsletter, I don't believe that perception is substantively true. But it would be a really good idea for us to *show* the public it's not true by shunning proven fraudsters from other industries, including Trump.

2. **I don't take Trump at his word about his promise to be "the crypto president" -- or on anything else for that matter.** Refer back to Point 1. Trump has repeated shown that his nature is fundamentally that of a con man. He says whatever will make the person in front of him vote for him at any given moment. If it suits him, he'll also say 180 degrees the opposite to a different person, even if the first statement was on-camera. And, no, even if you generally ... His efforts to on abortion are absurd on their face. Even other Republicans on this year's down-ballot haven't been so utterly, ridiculously shameless.

3. **There are demonstrable reasons to believe a Harris administration would have a lighter touch than Biden's.** She's not 80, she represented California in the Senate previously, and is close to Silicon Valley.
