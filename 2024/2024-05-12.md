**Earnings season** is [winding down](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/wall-street-turns-up-the-heat-on-companies-to-perform-12010d2b?st=n7xqb1ajqubi7q0&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) on Wall Street, when the largest public companies in the U.S. announce their profits. That includes several whose results for the first quarter were significantly shaped by crypto -- and in some cases offer hints about its future.

A few highlights:

- **Robinhood** handily beat analysts' expectations thanks to its crypto trading revenue, which more than tripled in the first quarter compared to a year ago. However, the firm also disclosed that its crypto unit is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may announce an enforcement action soon. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/293343/robinhood-posts-q1-earnings-beat-sees-224-increase-in-crypto-trading-volume))

- **Block,** maker of the payment apps Cash and Square, also [beat analysts' expectations](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/block-stock-soars-q1-earnings-223531876.html). The company was bolstered in part by a program to steadily buy bitcoin for its corporate treasury -- a practice it will continue through 2024. Block's strong earnings the last two quarters have propeled the company's market valuation high enough that it may [enter the S&P 500](https://coingape.com/news/stocks/jack-dorseys-block-inc-to-enter-sp-500-barclays/) soon.

- **Earlier this month,** Coinbase announced its quarterly revenue hit $1.64 billion, well ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $1.34 billion. The trading platform has recently seen a big increase in consumer transactions, as well as an increasing role as a custodian of bitcoin for institutions offering exchange-traded funds pegged to that token.

- **Big Tech's economic dominance** has also shined through loud and clear in this season's earnings reports. Just 10 companies, most of them tech giants like Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft, now hold 34% of the cash on S&P 500 companies' balance sheets.
