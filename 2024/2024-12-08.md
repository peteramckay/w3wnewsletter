_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based content creator with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization with other people getting up to speed on such stuff.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_

 _**To reach me directly with feedback, a story suggestion, or other queries, please email peter[at]w3w[dot]media.**_

 _**Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_ ðŸ˜Š
