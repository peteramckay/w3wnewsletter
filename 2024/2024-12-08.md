<!-- 100-word intro. Some possibilities:

- Riff on quote by Friedman ~18 mins into UK interview you recently watched on YouTube. He makes a great point: AI was not mentioned at all during the recent U.S. presidential election. Yikes.

- Are more altcoin ETFs on the way now that US regulation is easing? Bloomberg TV reporter raised this possibility.

- What about companies putting BTC in their treasury? Recent comments by MicroStrategy -- and their long-term accumulation -- could be a good hook to address it.

- Riff on wtf happened in '71: https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/ | McCormack episode that shouted it out: https://whatbitcoindid.libsyn.com/steve-baker-on-why-government-is-failing-you-mob020

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based content creator with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization with other people getting up to speed on such stuff.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_
