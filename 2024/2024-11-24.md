**Not yet.**

Bitcoin stalled just [a few hundred dollars shy](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-spoofing-btc-price-97-4-k-record-profit-taking) of hitting the long-awaited $100,000 milestone on Friday. But no matter.

Longtime investors are still in an ebullient mood, a new all-time high has been set, and the longer-term bull market has gained second wind due to optimism that friendlier crypto regulation is on the way in America from the forthcoming Trump administration.

Some highlights:

- **Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler,** a staunch crypto foe, announced Thursday [he will resign](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/sec-chair-gensler-will-step-down-jan-20-making-way-for-trump-replacement.html) effective Jan. 20, the day Donald Trump will be sworn in as president. Democratic appointee Jaime LizÃ¡rraga also said he plans to [leave the commission](https://decrypt.co/293207/another-democrat-quits-sec-gensler).

- **Trump nominated a pair of pro-blockchain financiers for cabinet positions.** Hedge-fund manager Scott Bessent was tapped to be [Treasury Secretary](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/22/trump-plans-to-name-pro-crypto-hedge-fund-manager-scott-bessent-as-treasury-secretary). Cantor Fitzgerald founder Howard Lutnick, a longtime [banking partner](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/howard-lutnick-giancarlo-devasini-tether-cryptocurrency-3d0a961c?st=m9XfjC&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) to stablecoin issuer Tether, was nominated for [Commerce Secretary](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/business/commerce-secretary-trump-crypto/index.html). Both have to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

- **A new crypto czar?** Trump is also reportedly weighing appointment of the first White House-level "crypto czar" to coordinate policies affecting the industry across all federal agencies. ([Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-team-weighs-creating-first-ever-crypto-czar/))

- **As of Sunday evening in New York,** bitcoin was trading around $97,000 per token, up 8% for the week. Heading into the last few weeks of 2024, it's up 129% for the year to date, well ahead of the S&P 500's 25% gain.  

- **Veteran commodity strategist George Milling-Stanley,** of State Street Global Advisors, fretted in an [interview with CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/bitcoin-vs-gold-state-street-worries-about-crypto-rally.html) that the bitcoin rally may be drawing investor attention away from gold, a more traditional safe haven against economic turbulence.
