**Perhaps what democracy really dies from** is self-inflicted injury.

Sadly, the [Washington Post](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris) and [Los Angeles Times](https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/los-angeles-times-editorials-editor-resigns-after-owner-blocks-presidential-endorsement.php) just suffered serious harm of exactly that sort.

Each paper's billionaire owner has decided at the 11th hour to cancel his editorial board's endorsement for U.S. president. That in turn has triggered staff resignations, open criticism of management, and reader wariness about possible meddling in future coverage.

The fallout for now seems especially brutal at the Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He penned [a column](https://news.google.com/read/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQV1hHUHBPNngzZW41ckpDY2VWUFI0VEdCNklTUkRRczgwNUZSeXk4SXRocXpteE5SWDlYcDl4Wll4UUZLNXMzVXJMcmxNODlCTEYyZlBrUDhPT2tRRlhVQmxSSzEwb0RmT01VLXJwMlN2VVZZOENLWFdUNkMxQnp2N1NMRnhQODRiT3BvXw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) on Monday to defend the paper's non-endorsement as a measure to boost its credibility as a nonpartisan institution.

Nevertheless, the Post said last week that more than 250,000 readers have [canceled their subscriptions](https://apnews.com/article/washington-post-endorsement-subscribers-c8380f19023322fe3c4bc1ab8541c14c), about 10% of the paper's subscriber base. That revenue hit, at a time when the Post has already been [losing money](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/23/media/washington-post-will-lewis-turnaround-plan/index.html), will almost certainly [translate to newsroom cuts](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/washington-post-staffers-fear-fallout-amid-subscriber-exodus-38fff88b?st=Ybcja2&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) in the near future.

For that reason, as a long-ago cub reporter at the Post myself, I have to say [I don't think ](https://x.com/peteramckay/status/1851994906442563708) canceling your Post subscription is a good way to register disapproval right now. Much better, as Slate's Laura Miller [recommends](https://slate.com/business/2024/10/washington-post-endorsement-election-cancel-jeff-bezos.html), to cancel your Amazon Prime subscription to hit Bezos where it will *really* hurt.

### Week in Review: Oct. 27 to Nov. 2, 2024

- **The odds of a Kamala Harris win** have been rising [on Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/) heading into Tuesday's presidential vote in America, boosted by traders [hedging earlier bets](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/01/harris-odds-rise-on-polymarket-as-election-fraud-allegations-ramp-up-trump-hedge-bets/) on Donald Trump. The Polygon-based prediction platform recently put the vice president's chance of victory at 46%, up from 33% on Wednesday. Polymarket's current reading for Harris is now roughly in line with the news site Fivethirtyeight's [probability model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/).

- **Google CEO Sundar Pichai** said more than 25% of new code for the company's products is now being written by AI. ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/google-ceo-says-over-25-of-new-google-code-is-generated-by-ai/))

- **Web3 startups raised $1.4 billion** in venture investment in the third quarter. That brings the total for 2024 so far to [5.4 billion](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vc-roundup-web3-funding-5-4-billion-2024), according to Crunchbase data. One particular bright spot: decentralized apps built on the Solana chain. Cointelegraph reports that investment in that cateogry [jumped 54%](https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-investments-solana-dapps-54-percent-q3) to $173 million in the third period.

- **However, some companies in the industry** are laying off workers due to worries about possible turbulence ahead. Consensys, DYdX, and Kraken were among the notable names announcing cutbacks of at least 15% of headcount last week. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/289687/bitcoin-surging-why-crypto-layoffs))

- **Two Ethereum Foundation researchers resigned** from advisory roles at the re-staking platform EigenLayer to quell community concerns about possible conflicts of interest. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/02/ethereum-researchers-relinquish-eigenlayer-roles-over-conflict-of-interest-concerns/))

- **UBS Asset Management launched** a new money market fund on the Ethereum chain. ([CryptoSlate](https://cryptoslate.com/ubs-launches-its-first-tokenized-fund-on-ethereum-blockchain/))

- **Emory University disclosed** that it holds $16 million of its endowment in an exchange-traded fund holding bitcoin. That makes Emory the first educational institution to make a significant investment in bitcoin ETFs, according to [Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas](https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1850884568553013459).

- **America's Treasury Department is ramping up** scrutiny of foreign real-estate deals near the country's military bases. The move is a followup to the agency's shutdown of a Chinese-backed crypto mining operation near a Wyoming nuclear base earlier this year. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/01/plan-a-crypto-mine-near-a-us-military-base-expect-a-bigger-hassle-now/))  

- **President Biden thanked** his Nigerian counterpart for releasing a jailed Binance executive who is a U.S. national on medical grounds. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/289022/biden-thanks-nigerian-president-binance-exec))

### Odds & Ends

- **China cracked down on... Halloween costumes?** Police were vigilant in Shanghai and other cities during the week's spooky holiday for anyone dressed to make a sly political statement. Yikes. ([Washington Post](https://news.google.com/read/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQeF9LNzljYkVXc2VTZ2gyMTcySFFpbnhhRmhlT2hNUWJVcTh6X2pNekQxQUhGVlVMR2l0LXFQYjd1dVBJYnplc1FsclZUSXBEbTJMbGhrZzZFVTRQYlVtRGpqcHNfaTQzN1JQZDMzaUxkZkpHNXZjaS1oZFlFTTdoejd1M3VrdWVLS0xjUFJLbHlCd1E?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **The BBC reports that some rando** tried to [charge admission](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c079zp2vy31o) *to a press conference* in London on Thursday to "announce" that he's Satoshi Nakamoto. You know, like a person holding billions of dollars in bitcoin would probably do. ðŸ¤£
