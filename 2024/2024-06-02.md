# Whither web2?
## tktktk

<p><em>By Peter A. McKay</em></p>

In very different ways, two recent tech stories highlighted the benefits and, more important, the downsides of web2.

The first is today's New York Times story by TKTKTK about the TKTKTKTK, tktktktk.

The second is the leak of documents that give us new insight into how Google search really works: https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167119/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-seo-chrome-clicks | https://www.engadget.com/google-is-putting-more-restrictions-on-ai-overviews-after-it-told-people-to-put-glue-on-pizza-011316780.html

### Week in Review: May 26 to June 1, 2024

- **ETF updates:** https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether-etf-launch-june-possible-blackrock-amended-s-1 | https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/30/ether-spot-etfs-to-see-much-lower-demand-than-bitcoin-versions-jpmorgan-says/ | https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-on-verge-of-eclipsing-grayscales-fund-4c90e499

- **Robinhood announced** the release of a new application programming interface (API) that will allow U.S. crypto traders to set up automated strategies. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/robinhood-crypto-trading-api-united-states))

- **The New York Stock Exchange's president** said during a panel discussion at CoinDesk's Consensus conference the the venerable Wall Street trading venue would [consider offering crypto trading](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/05/29/nyse-would-consider-crypto-trading-if-regulatory-picture-were-clearer-president-says-at-consensus-2024/) if U.S. regulations were clearer.

- **Two big Washington Post stories:** Tech beat writer Drew Harwell reports that TikTok [made an extraordinary offer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/29/tiktok-cfius-proposal-rejected/) to the American government in 2022 to let federal officials pick TikTok's U.S. board of directors, monitor its source code, and have access to a "kill switch" that could shut the service down at any time. Harwell reports the Biden administration declined the offer, instead choosing to push ahead with a new law that would force a sale of TikTok outright. Separately, Post columnist Lee Hockstader says Russia is [brazenly spreading disinformation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/29/tiktok-cfius-proposal-rejected/) online to influence next month's European Union Parliament elections. The propaganda campaign is likely a harbinger of what U.S. users will see heading into November's presidential election here.  

- **The Block's Elizabeth Napolitano** reports that President Joe Biden‚Äôs re-election campaign has [begun reaching out](https://www.theblock.co/post/297504/biden-campaign-shifts-crypto-stance-engages-crypto-industry-presidential-elections-2024) to crypto-industry players over the past two weeks for guidance on crypto policy. The outreach represents a notable shift away from the administration's more adversarial stance toward crypto to date.

- **Ryan Salame, the former chief of FTX's Bahamas unit,** was sentenced by a federal judge in New York to 7-1/2 years in prison. He is the first of exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried's lieutenants to get jail time in connection with FTX's collapse in late 2022. ([Bloomberg](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/first-of-bankman-fried-ftx-lieutenants-gets-75-years-in-prison/ar-BB1nbBMc))

- **A federal judge in Utah** dismissed a civil enforcement case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the crypto miner DEBT Box and ordered the regulator to pay $1.8 million in DEBT Box's legal fees. Ouch. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/232809/sec-debt-box-case-dismissed))

### Odds & Ends

- **After a three-year research project,** Major League Baseball has incorporated the performance of Negro League players from the 1920s through the 1940s into the sport's statistical canon. As a result, legendary Negro League catcher Bob Gibson became the new holder of several career and single-season MLB records previously held by Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, and Barry Bonds. Wow.
