**Two Washington Post tech stories** last week are worth highighting for anyone concerned about the effect of foreign disinformation on Western democracy. Both provide insight into the ad-hoc methods governments are employing against the problem lately, for better or worse.

Tech beat writer Drew Harwell reports that TikTok [made an extraordinary offer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/29/tiktok-cfius-proposal-rejected/) to the American government in 2022 to let federal officials pick TikTok's U.S. board of directors, monitor its source code, and have access to a "kill switch" that could shut the service down at any time.

Harwell reports the Biden administration declined the offer, instead choosing to push ahead with a new law that would force a sale of TikTok outright, or else ban it in the U.S. altogether.

Ostensibly, the administration is concerned that TikTok is Chinese-owned, thus could be used by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on or unduly influence Americans. On the other hand, a potential ban could [run afoul](https://peteramckay.medium.com/congress-isnt-going-to-fix-web2-7b1818ea9fc0) of the First Amendment.

Separately, Paris-based columnist Lee Hockstader says Russia is [brazenly spreading disinformation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/29/tiktok-cfius-proposal-rejected/) online to influence next month's European Union Parliament elections. The propaganda campaign is likely a harbinger of what U.S. users will see heading into November's presidential election here, Hockstader says.  

On to the rest of the week's headlines, none of them nearly so apocalyptic as the above. I promise...

### Week in Review: May 26 to June 1, 2024
- **President Biden vetoed** legislation that [would have changed](https://www.theblock.co/post/297885/biden-vetoes-bill-overturning-sab-121-says-standard-necessary-for-crypto-innovation) a controversial accounting rule affecting financial firms that hold crypto tokens for customers. But the industry still holds hope for passage of a separate bill [nicknamed FIT21](https://crypto.news/mchenry-pushes-for-senate-approval-of-fit21-crypto-bill/) that would clarify the roles of different federal agencies in regulating crypto. The Block's Elizabeth Napolitano reports that Biden‚Äôs re-election campaign has [begun reaching out](https://www.theblock.co/post/297504/biden-campaign-shifts-crypto-stance-engages-crypto-industry-presidential-elections-2024) to industry players over the past two weeks for guidance on crypto policy.

Meanwhile, BlackRock is also among a [raft of Wall Street firms](https://coingape.com/breaking-spot-ethereum-etf-issuers-asked-by-sec-to-submit-updated-s-1-filings-by-friday/) jockeying to offer spot ETFs on ether as well, after U.S. regulators recently okayed exchanges to list such funds. One big player [dropped out](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/cathie-woods-ark-investment-drops-plans-for-spot-ether-etf-says-it-will-focus-on-spot-bitcoin-etf-instead/ar-BB1nuhAj) of that race, however: Cathie Woods' Ark Investment Management.
- **Gemini announced Wednesday** that users of its crypto lending accounts have received all their digital assets back in-kind as part of a settlement with bankrupt partner Genesis.

- **Eureka?** Researchers have unlocked a $3 million crypto wallet that had been dormant for 11 years by exploiting a bug in an old version of a password manager. ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/roboform-password-3-million-dollar-crypto-wallet/))
### Odds & Ends
