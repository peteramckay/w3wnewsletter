### Week in Review: April 7-13, 2024

- **The Bitcoin network's next "halving" is near,** expected [later in this week](https://www.theblock.co/post/288015/bitcoin-halving-countdown-one-week-to-go). Halvings are periodic events mandated in Bitcoin's programming to slow the issuance of new tokens, effectively limiting overall supply. Bets ahead of this halving have helped propel bitcoin to a gain of almost 60% so far in 2024. (By comparison, the S&P 500 stock index is up 7%.) But last week was an exception to that broader trend in bitcoin prices, as a [wave of selling Friday](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/12/bitcoin-plunges-to-66k-altcoins-tumble-10-15-on-ugly-day-for-risk-assets/) left the token with a 7-day decline of 2% as of yesterday afternoon in New York.
