# Some unexpected common ground between Dimon and bitcoiners

**JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon** surprised many colleagues and investors last week by fretting about [a possible resurgence of inflation](https://www.wsj.com/finance/jamie-dimon-warns-u-s-might-face-interest-rate-spike-83789da7?st=ez2fgov0m0m4wye&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) and official interest rates in the U.S.

Coming into 2024, we were supposed to be past such worries. Everyone in the financial industry was eagerly anticipating rate cuts, not hikes, from the Federal Reserve. But that all might have been premature, according to Wall Street's biggest fish.

In his [annual letter](https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2023/ar-ceo-letters.htm) to JPMorgan shareholders, Dimon writes:

*There is too much emphasis on short-term, monthly data and too little on long-term trends and on what might happen in the future that would influence long-term outcomes. For example, today there is tremendous interest in monthly inflation data, although it seems to me that every long-term trend I see increases inflation relative to the last 20 years. Huge fiscal spending, the trillions needed each year for the green economy, the remilitarization of the world and the restructuring of global trade â€” all are inflationary. Iâ€™m not sure models could pick this up. And you must use judgment if you want to evaluate impacts like these.*

Funny thing is, this macroeconomic diagnosis is pretty much same one you would hear from many bitcoiners -- a group Dimon has often [been at odds](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-tells-davos-bitcoin-172918767.html) with.

Just to cite some examples from one widely followed bitcoin news source: You can hear concerns similar to Dimon's about mounting U.S. spending, debt, and inflation from guests on Peter McCormack's podcast [here](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/repricing-the-world-in-bitcoin), [here](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/2024-the-year-of-the-bitcoin-bull), [here](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/the-debt-tsunami), and [here](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/macro-fed-pivot-bitcoin), all at least two months before Dimon published his letter.

Of course, he would still disagree vehemently with such folks about what investors should *do* about inflation risk, particularly whether buying bitcoin is the answer. But perhaps he (and the rest of us) should at least be a little more reticent to paint them as crackpots.

### Week in Review: April 7-13, 2024

- **The Bitcoin network's next "halving" is near,** expected [late this week](https://www.theblock.co/post/288015/bitcoin-halving-countdown-one-week-to-go). Halvings are periodic events mandated in Bitcoin's programming to slow the issuance of new tokens, effectively limiting overall supply. Bets ahead of this halving have helped propel bitcoin to a gain of almost 60% so far in 2024. (By comparison, the S&P 500 stock index is up 7%.) But last week was an exception to that broader trend in bitcoin prices, as a [wave of selling Friday](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/12/bitcoin-plunges-to-66k-altcoins-tumble-10-15-on-ugly-day-for-risk-assets/) left the token in the red. It posted a 7-day decline of 2% as of yesterday afternoon in New York.

- **The Securities and Exchange Commission** sent a notice to Uniswap on Wednesday that the popular decentralized finance (DeFi) platform may soon be the subject of an enforcement action. ([Quartz](https://qz.com/sec-crypto-exchange-uniswap-wells-notice-bitcoin-1851401789))

- **Stablecoin issuer Circle** launched smart-contract support for asset-management giant BlockRock's new platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The move means it will be easier for investors to exchange dollar-based value on the new platform in exchange for real estate, art, or other tokenized assets. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/287842/circle-launches-usdc-smart-contract-support-for-blackrock-buidl-holders))  

- **A new survey published by Deutsche Bank** on Monday showed consumers are becoming somewhat less skeptical about bitcoin's long-term potential as an asset class and payment mechanism. However, almost one-third of respondents said they expect its price to drop sharply at some point in 2024. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/crypto-survey-shows-less-consumer-scepticism-third-expect-bitcoin-price-fall-2024-04-08/))

- **The Zurich-based Dfinity Foundation** announced the launch of the Olympus Acceleration Platform. The new project will use the Internet Computer blockchain to enable teams around the world to launch their own startup accelerator programs. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/dfinity-launches-web3-accelerator-platform-internet-computer))

- **Bitcoiner Anthony Pompliano and ex-journalist Jacquelyn Melinek** have launched Token Relations, a new communications startup aimed at blockchain startups. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/04/09/pompliano-ex-journo-melinek-spin-up-token-relations-startup-for-blockchain-firms/))

- **FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried filed an appeal** of his recent criminal conviction in New York on federal fraud charges, as well as his 35-year jail sentence. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/287892/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-appeals-conviction-and-sentence))

### Odds & Ends

- **Salon columnist David Karem** argues that the U.S. government's prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, begun under Trump and continuing under Biden, signals that both major American political parties' commitment to free speech and free press is [waning dangerously](https://www.salon.com/2024/04/04/they-decided-to-get-even-with-him-revenge-against-julian-assange-broke-the-media/).

- **After more than 80 years,** modern DNA testing has allowed the U.S. Department of Defense to identify the remains of David Walker, a Black sailor who died in the attack at Pearl Harbor in 1941. Mr. Walker's story is emblematic of the more than 50 African-American mess attendants, cooks, and stewards who died at Pearl Harbor at a time when the U.S. military was still segregated. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/04/09/black-pearl-harbor-sailor-identified/))

- **The Washington Post published** a handy [interactive quiz](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/good-bad-economy-quiz-wages-inflation/) to help readers compare what they would like the U.S. economy to look like versus the reality reflected in actual data.
