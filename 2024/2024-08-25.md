Sam Altman's WorldCoin project




Why not aim AI at all the fakery and lies that are already out there, so it helps us catch the stuff rather than aid in its proliferation?

The impulse to create a new coin is strong. Not invented here.

Why can't you just send them bitcoin at fixed intervals?

# Why government is a necessary but imperfect tool against Big Tech
## Part 1 of 3 in a series about the levers for countering the platforms' oligarchy

_By_ [_Peter A. McKay_](https://pmckay.com)

**When mass usage of the web began spreading** back in the 1990s, absolutely no one was giddily rooting for a day to come when just a handful of giant public companies, all based in a single country and worth [over $1 trillion each](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trillion-dollar-companies-222307746.html), might dictate how everyone on earth experiences the web.

That was definitely *not* the goal. Yet here we are, facing exactly such as status quo.

I do still hold out hope the situation can be solved, however. Call me naive, but I see three major levers we can pull to make the web a more egalitarian place, as it was envisioned [early on](https://peteramckay.medium.com/a-brief-release-history-of-the-web-aeef5bb3b814).

Each lever has its own strengths and weaknesses, conveniently demonstrated by events of just the last few weeks, as I'll describe below.

No single one of these things alone can fix the ills of Big Tech -- a crucial qualifier I think we sometimes forget. But I believe a sustained combination of them, each used in proper measure over time, would make a massive difference for the better.

### 1) Government

This is perhaps the most obvious and well-publicized lever of late. The great strengths of the government are its unique powers under law and the sheer scale of its resources, which are a handy counterweight to the vast fortunes of Big Tech.

For example, in a court proceeding such as the U.S. Department of Justice's [successful antitrust suit](https://www.theverge.com/24215684/doj-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-google-monopoly-verdict-win-decoder-podcast-interview) against Google, decided earlier this month, the tech giant couldn't just delay interminably, run up the plaintiff's legal fees, and outlast it, as Google might have done with a smaller private-sector rival.

Of course, there's also the legislative option of writing entirely new laws to counter the downsides of emerging technologies as society adopts them. Congress is currently weighing a number of proposals in that vein regarding both crypto and AI, including a bill [passed by the Senate](https://decrypt.co/244411/u-s-senate-passes-anti-deepfake-law-targeting-non-consensual-pornography) on Monday creating civil penalties for pornographic "deepfake" images made without the depicted person's consent.

In my opinion, that's a great idea. But the bill also neatly illustrates one of the weaknesses of government action: It's slow.

In order to go into force as law, that Senate proposal still has to pass the 435-member House of Representatives as well and be signed by the President. Until that happens, really, no actual good has been accomplished. No one's actually been protected from anything.  

The situation is made even more dire by the currently heightened polarization of U.S. To a historic degree, the current Congress has been demonstrably unproductive in terms of ushering bills through all the steps to signage.








### 2) Reputation

Big Tech companies don't want to lose customers, and their employees like to cast themselves as good people in general. Maybe we can use that to cajole or convince them simply to act better on their own.

### 3) Evolution

Build and adopt new products in lieu of the Death Stars' stuff to break their grip on markets and mindshare. Notice I didn't call this process "innovation" - a somewhat abused word these days that only addresses makers' part of the equation. Users also have to play a role here by purposefully trying and migrating to new tools.

Frankly, I'd say some measure of each of the above approaches is probably in order right now, depending on which company and product category one is discussing. But in general, the option that's the most powerful, underutilized, and least discussed is the third - evolution.

As long as our conversation about tech is premised on the idea that everyone absolutely has to use Facebook until the sun flickers out in the sky, Facebook wins. Ditto with assuming Google's permanent dominance in search, Amazon's in retail, and so on.

Unfortunately, this is exactly what most tech press and even some people in the tech industry itself tend to assume, often tacitly. These assumptions then have a nasty way of becoming self-fulfilling.

The good news is that so could a vision of a world with less oligarchy if more people simply dared to imagine it, then set about making it happen, step by step.

**When I was a teenager,** you did not need to be an avid fight fan at all to be aware of three truly world-famous boxers: Mike Tyson, Buster Douglas, and Sugar Ray Leonard.

The one term the press frequently used to describe Mike Tyson in his heyday was "bully." He represents Big Tech.

Buster Douglas is in Iron Mike's weight class, so he's literally capable of going toe-to-toe with him. That's helpful as a starting point, of course, and he can sometimes deal Tyson a significant loss.

That said, any success he has against Mike is doomed to be fleeting. He's ultimately just not really at the same dazzling talent level. Plus he's big and slow. Yes, Douglas on his best day can be Tyson when he's having a bad day. But if they're *both* having a good day, Tyson wins every time.

Hence Douglas is like the government trying to regulate tech.

Leonard isn't in Tyson's weight class, but they're arguably of similar skill levels considering that they're both in the Boxing Hall of Fame. (Douglas isn't.) But if Leonard succeeds enough, he can always go up in weight class. So who knows what his ceiling is.

Hence Leonard is like a startup.
