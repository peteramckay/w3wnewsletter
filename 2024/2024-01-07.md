**Crypto might be on a path** to becoming the "Linux of finance," says Blockworks' Byron Gilliam in [his latest post](https://mail.blockworks.com/p/will-crypto-become-linux-finance).

If you're unfamiliar, Linux is an open operating system developed in the 1990s as an alternative to proprietary platforms like Windows. It has since become absolutely essential to our everyday experience of the internet, even if it's not necessarily a household name brand among non-geeks.

Guaranteed, Linux runs the servers for almost every major internet service you use everyday. Ditto most devices that have chips in them and do computer-y things but don't look like computers -- all the internet televisions, the touchscreens that aren't iPads in stores and airplanes and taxis, and "smart home" appliances, for example.

Since 2021, NASA has been flying a [Linux-powered aerial drone](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291324/linux-perseverance-mars-curiosity-ingenuity) on Mars. And some odballs back here on earth even use Linux to [run our personal laptops](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linux-my-ecosystem-peter-mckay/). ☺️

So why might this make an apt metaphor for the future of crypto? Gilliam explains:

*The principles of decentralized crypto are likely to influence a blockchain-based financial system in the same way that the open-source Linux community has exerted outsized influence on the for-profit software industry — and the for-profit finance industry may make vital contributions to open-source crypto in the same way that the software industry does with Linux.*

*Crypto purists may see that as a partial victory, at best, but it might turn out to be a win-win outcome, as with the all-conquering software industry.*

*The internet as we know it would not exist without open-source Linux and open-source blockchains may become its financial equivalent: A decentralized core that enables a much larger for-profit, centralized ecosystem.*

This scenario is very different from the more zero-sum predictions we often hear in which crypto straight-up *replaces* elements of traditional finance. Maybe there is more room than we realize for them to continue alongside each other, complementing each other and radically transforming familiar products along the way.

# Week in Review

- **Will they, or won't they?** CoinDesk reports that at least two proposed issuers of a U.S.-listed bitcoin fund are expecting to [win regulatory approval](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/05/final-bitcoin-etf-application-filings-get-posted-by-major-us-exchanges/) sometime this week. Recent public filings by several issuers and public exchanges seem to reflect such expectations as well. But a significant chunk of Wall Street remains skeptical. In a recent poll conducted by Bitwise and VettaFi, [just 39% of investment advisors](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitwise-vettafi-advisor-survey-reveals-180500523.html) said they expect an exchange-traded bitcoin fund to be approved this year.

- **Satoshi Nakamoto's original bitcoin wallet** received $1.2 million Friday from an unnamed Binance user. Satoshi's so-called "genesis" wallet now holds $4.3 million in bitcoin -- a fraction of the $47 billion in tokens Satoshi is believed to control overall. But he hasn't made any outgoing transfers in over a decade. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/270748/someone-sent-1-2-million-of-bitcoin-to-the-genesis-wallet-mined-by-satoshi-nakamoto))

- **Block explorer Solscan** announced it has [been acquired](https://solscan.substack.com/p/solscan-becomes-a-part-of-etherscan?r=1mvpxo) by rival Etherscan. The move will make it easier to query on-chain data at a time when activity on the Solana network has been hitting [fresh 12-month highs](https://www.theblock.co/post/270183/solana-transaction-volume-hits-highest-level-in-more-than-a-year-as-memecoin-activity-increases).

- **In an interview with Cointelegraph,** Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed analyst predictions that USDC could soon surpass USDT as the most widely held stablecoin. In particular, [Adoino is optimistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIQcJzouYow) about USDT's usage among individual crypto traders versus institutions.

- **Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius** said it will unstake $466 million in Ethereum as part of is efforst to repay creditors. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/211799/celsius-to-unstake-466-million-ethereum-holdings-ensure-ample-liquidity-for-creditors))

# Odds & Ends

- **Uh-oh.** CNBC market pundit Jim Cramer, who has previously made several comically ill-timed calls regarding bitcoin, now says [he's bullish](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/02/jim-cramer-capitulates-on-bitcoin-technological-marvel-its-here-to-stay/) on it.

- **New research is casting doubt** on the supposed productivity gains of working from home. ([The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/06/28/the-working-from-home-delusion-fades))
