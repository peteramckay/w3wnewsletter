## Hint: It will probably be a certain other social company you don't like.

Lede item. Should run ~450 words. Lay out your theory of the 4-part crypto market and why it matters.

- OPENSOCIAL: Roundup of open standards. Shout out Our biggest fight folks.
- 4PART: The four-part market and why it matters.

Is this crypto stuff going to last?

Short answer: Yes.

Longer answer: The first three parts mentioned above will certainly last. Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached such a scale that they certainly are going to last. So will stablecoins as a category, although there may be winners and losers along the way. In other words, I can't necessarily tell you that the exact stablecoins that are widely used today will be the same ones in wide use 10 years from now. But there will certainly be *something* along those lines still in use.

The fourth part -- "everything else" -- contains a mix of stuff that will last and stuff that won't.

OK. But where do I even start?

Read up on the first three categories, gain a thorough understanding, and invest where you believe there is the most value. As for the fourth category, you can safely ignore it as a newbie.

- MLBAI: Yes, MLB could provide examples of AI's applications -- and how they might affect other sorts of workplaces. But MLB is also already providing great examples of how data can be abused. Why is OBP down? Why are pitchers' arms falling apart? How do you judge relevance of a particular piece of data to the mission of an organization and the day-to-day execution of it?
