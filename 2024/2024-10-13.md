### Odds & Ends

- "I feel like the more I watch videos of cooking, the more I‚Äôm convinced I have no idea how to peel, boil, drain, or cut anything the 'right' way." -- [@alischwanke](https://x.com/alischwanke/status/1838734711679488454)

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based creator with more than seven years' experience in marketing and content about web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning at the time about blockchain tech and decentralization with other people interested in such stuff.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_
