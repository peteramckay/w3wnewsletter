The bitcoiner, a person who does have the wherewithal to make significant contributions, was offended as he recounted this story. He was trying to talk right and wrong, fair and unfair, but the elected official just wanted to talk campaign cash.

He hasn't given a dollar, according to OpenSecrets.






**If you're a fan of crypto,** recent events in Washington are hugely encouraging. If you're a fan of U.S. democracy, they're dispiriting.

If you're a fan of both, as I am, you have mixed feelings. The above interests don't necessarily have to be a trade-off, but somehow we've managed to make them so here in the U.S.

- The SEC's "war on crypto" has inadvertently had the effect of strengthening its dominant duopoly of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

- The public is mostly tuned out.

- Increased donations and lobbying are paying off for the industry. This is an awful game, but the crypto industry is getting much better at it, for better or worse.

- Election-year politicking is helping, not hurting, crypto. Both major-party candidates are signaling detente with the industry.
