        <br>

        <p><strong>The bloodletting in crypto</strong> slowed but didn't quite end last week.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin posted a weekly decline of almost 10% and global crypto market capitalization was off about 1% as of late Saturday, versus declines multiple times larger the previous week.</p>

        <p>While that's hardly great news for investors, the recent ebbing of the selloff has at least left room to see a few bright spots that remain. Startups and open-source communities have continued to plug away at new products, institutional money is still trickling in, and new blockchain ecosystems are gradually maturing to handle different use cases, even as daily price swings continue to dominate press attention.</p>

        <p>The latest headlines:</p>


        <ul>

          <li><strong>A new Bitcoin Mining Council formed to address environmental impact.</strong> Members will publish data about their use of renewable energy and encourage other mining operations to adopt such technology as well. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-bitcoin-mining-council-required-to-combat-hostile-narrative">spearheaded</a> formation of the new group expressly as an attempt to counter the "hostile narrative" about Bitcoin's power consumption that's recently gotten heavy media coverage.</li>


          <li><strong>Look who's buying the crypto dip (or not).</strong> Large investors bought more than <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106266/whales-bought-3-billion-of-bitcoin-when-its-price-fell-says-chainalysis">$3 billion of bitcoin</a> during the recent market dip, according to a <a href="https://markets.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-05-26">new report</a> by Chainalysis. Separately, Glassnode says publicly available information about bitcoin wallets shows the number of long-term bitcoin holders is now at an <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/number-of-bitcoin-accumulation-addresses-hit-record-high">all-time high</a>, comprising 2.8 million BTC. Among the individual names making pro-crypto remarks last week were football legend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/tom-brady-says-hes-a-big-believer-in-cryptocurrencies.html">Tom Brady</a>, as well as Wall Street heavyweights <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-ray-dalio-i-have-some-bitcoin">Ray Dalio</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/carl-icahn-bitcoin-crypto-big-way">Carl Icahn</a>, and Todd Morley, who's especially <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/105935/ethereum-much-higher-utility-bitcoin-guggenheim-todd-morley">bullish on Ethereum</a>. But billionaire Bill Ackman remains a vocal holdout, saying crypto is <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106303/billionaire-investor-bill-ackman-bitcoin-speculative-crypto">too speculative</a> for his tastes as an investor.</li>

         <li><strong>Uniswap seems poised to expand to the Ethereum scaling solution Arbitrum,</strong> The Block <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106277/uniswap-likely-to-expand-to-ethereum-scaling-solution-arbitrum">reports</a>. Separately, the Wall Street Journal published its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/upstart-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges-take-aim-at-coinbase-11621848601">first big story</a> on Uniswap, noting that the platform may be drawing some lending away from conventional banks.</li>

         <li><strong>PayPal plans to allow customers to withdraw cryptocurrency to third-party wallets.</strong> The payment giant's blockchain lead <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-will-let-customers-withdraw-crypto-exec-says">revealed</a> the upcoming changes in remarks at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021 conference.</li>

         <li><strong>Andreesen Horowitz's new crypto fund</strong> could top <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106605/a16z-2-billion-valuation-crypto-fund?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss">$2 billion</a>. Wowza.</li>

        <li><strong>Chia's president and chief operating officer</strong> said the payments platform is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-payments-platform-chia-on-an-accelerated-timeline-to-ipo">aiming to do an initial public offering</a> of its stock soon.</li>

         <li><strong>The GameStop saga has taken some unexpected blockchain-y twists.</strong> The retailer is now building a <a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">platform for non-fungible tokens</a>. Separately, the Reddit group Wall Street Bets, which drove an infamous short squeeze in GameStop shares earlier this year, is now <a href="https://decrypt.co/71884/redditors-are-turning-crypto-not-gamestop-amid-market-volatility">allowing posts about crypto</a> markets as well. It previously had a stocks-only policy.</li>

         <li><strong>The right-to-repair movement is gaining momentum because of COVID.</strong> Controversies over fixing malfunctioning ventilators whose designs the manufacturers fought to protect as proprietary intellectual property have highlighted the right-to-repair issue for many non-geeks for the first time. As a result, several U.S. states are now considering new right-to-repair laws, with a particular focus on medical equipment, Slate <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/05/in-the-land-of-broken-things-response-right-to-repair.html">reports</a>.</li>

         <li><strong>Cointelegraph released a short documentary on the history of cryptography.</strong> Granted, it isn't exactly Date Night viewing. But if you otherwise want a solid, layman-friendly introduction to the subject matter, they definitely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTDYRl1uaMI">did a good job</a> with this one. üëç</li>
