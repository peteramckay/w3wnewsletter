        <br>

        <p><strong>A brief, enthusiastic podcast pick</strong> to get started this time:</p>
	<p>Ex-Facebooker <strong>Anthony Pompliano</strong> just did an excellent episode in which he interviews programmer <strong>Isaiah Jackson</strong> about bitcoin's potential to economically empower Black America.</p>
	<p>Based on private conversations, I know this is a topic of interest to several readers of this newsletter as well. So I definitely want to call it to your attention.</p>
	<p>In their 30-minute talk, which you can check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtOc7B8bJyI">here</a>, "Pomp" and Isaiah cover a lot of ground about bitcoin as a solution to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/">redlining</a> in traditional finance, deflation vesus inflation, and more. Plus they drop a couple of killer quotes, like this one:</p>
	<p>"F!#@ the banks."</p>
	
	<p>Well, then! ðŸ˜‚ On to the rest of the week's news:</p>



        <ul>

          <li><strong>Ether hit a new all-time high.</strong> The number-two cryptocurrency, which is the basis of the Ethereum ecosystem, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/91657/eth-price-breaks-previous-all-time-high-record-1420-after-three-years">topped $1,400</a>, breaking its previous record set in January 2018. Ethereum has recently been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-whats-next-for-ethereum-cryptocurrency-all-time-high">bolstered</a> by its increasing usage as a tool to build decentralized finance apps, as well as the initial rollout of version 2.0 of its network software. The recent gains have pushed ether's market capitalization above $152 billion.</li>


          <li><strong>BitMEX Research said it documented a dreaded "double spend" on the bitcoin blockchain, though several independent analysts dismissed the claim.</strong> The term "double spend" refers to a scenario in which the same token is used in more than one transaction -- a major pitfall to be avoided for bitcoin's core principle of scarcity to work. After looking at BitMEX's data, most analysts said the transactions BitMEX had flagged were verified <a href="https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/was-there-a-bitcoin-double-spend-on-jan-20-2021/">slowly but correctly</a> in the end, without true double spend. Nevertheless, the incident has set off a controversey that continues among crypto developers about what the optimal consensus method for a blockchain network should look like. In essence, the bitcoin community's best defense to BitMEX's complaint boils down to: "Hey, we didn't get it wrong. We were just slow." But slowness is also a problem in its own right.</li>

	<li><strong>Bitcoin sagged, although Wall Street remains keen on it.</strong> The flagship cryptocurrency tumbled 8% for the week, recently trading above $32,000. But the financial industry's biggest players continued to take early steps toward getting involved. CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-to-enter-crypto-market-soon-with-custody-play-source">reported</a> that <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>JPMorgan</strong> and <strong>Citi</strong> are all looking at establishing custodial services to hold bitcoin on behalf of clients. And recent regulatory filings by asset-management giant <strong>BlackRock</strong> would <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/91867/blackrock-sec-filings-bitcoin-futures">open the way</a> for the firm to invest in bitcoin futures in some of its funds.</li>


         <li><strong>Misinformation is down 73% on Twitter</strong> since the platform banned Donald Trump, according to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/16/misinformation-trump-twitter/">new analysis by Zignal Labs</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>The Electronic Frontier Foundation published a transition memo for the new Biden administration.</strong> The <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/eff-transition-memo-incoming-biden-administration">document</a> essentially serves as a handy primer on major tech-policy issues right now, including privacy, broadband access, antitrust, and more. (One minor pet peeve, though: EFF's memo is oddly silent on crypto. You know, that thing with a nearly $1 trillion market cap, a murky regulatory picture, and potential to disrupt Wall Street? Seems kinda important, guys.)</li>

          
          <li><strong>Chinese tech billionaire Jack Ma made his first public appearance in months after a mysterious disappearance.</strong> The Alibaba co-founder hadn't been seen since shortly after his company's initial stock offering was abruptly halted by the government following his remarks calling for freer regulation of tech. But he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/20/chinese-billionaire-jack-ma-makes-first-public-appearance-in-months">resurfaced on Wednesday</a> in an online ceremony for 100 rural teachers. He was also shown in a video touring a primary school in his home town of Hangzhou.

</li>

       
          <li><strong>Build a cheaper soccer ball, and the world will beat a path to your door.</strong> Fast Company <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90596662/the-soccer-ball-gets-a-radical-redesign">reports</a> on the Japanese design firm <strong>Nendo</strong>'s efforts to build a soccer ball made entirely from interlocking parts rather than the traditional construction of panels over an inflatable bladder. The old method also necessitates buying a pump to occasionally re-inflate the ball, makes it difficult to repair if the bladder pops, and pushes the ball's price to about $12 -- a significant sum for families in some developing countries. By comparison, Nendo's ball needs no pump and can be fixed one piece at a time if necessary, so more kids can play away. Pretty cool stuff indeed. ðŸ˜€ âš½</li>

        </ul>
