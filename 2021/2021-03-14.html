        <p><strong>Record bitcoin prices are back.</strong> But for once that may not even be the biggest story happening in blockchain.</p>

        <p>Two other industry trends are also exploding right now, stealing some of ol' BTC's thunder. One is the sudden popularity of digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the other, somewhat longer-running phenomenon is the rise of Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) tools aimed at supplanting conventional forms of borrowing and lending.</p>

        <p>The rise of these use cases for blockchain helps explain why bitcoin's <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#dominance-percentage">share</a> of the global crypto market has barely budged from about 60% since late January, despite its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-spikes-to-new-record-high-near-60k">new all-time above $61,000</a> set on Saturday. Due to the twin NFT and DeFi tsunamis, ether and other altcoins have kept pace with bitcoin the whole way through the rally -- and in some cases even beaten bitcoin handily.</p>

        <p>The rapid gains have also pushed the global crypto market's total valuation <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">within reach</a> of $2 trillion for the first time.</p>

        <p>The latest headlines:</p>


        <ul>

          <li><strong>The Ethereum community voted to overhaul its fee structure.</strong> Users and developers lauded a new proposal designed to make transaction costs more predictable. But miners are livid as the plan will cut their revenue. (<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-improvement-proposal-1559-london-hard-fork">CoinDesk</a>)</li>

          <li><strong>NFT auctions galore.</strong> A piece of digital artwork rendered as an NFT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html">sold for $69 million</a> at auction, in the first such sale ever conducted by the venerable Christie's. Separately, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/07/tech/jack-dorsey-nft-twitter/index.html">selling</a> the first tweet in the network's history, posted by himself in 2006, as an NFT. The bidding closes on March 21 and has garnered a top offer of $2.5 million so far. Proceeds from the sale have been <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367990471759306752?s=21">earmarked by @jack</a> to go toward COVID relief in Africa. Bravo!</li>

          <li><strong>Meanwhile, downsides to NFT mainia are emerging as well.</strong> Some hackers have been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/hacker-selling-cybersecurity-exploit-nft">offering cybersecurity exploits</a> as NFTs. And DC Comics' chief counsel <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/dc-comics-tells-artists-to-stay-out-of-nft-business-or-1846466427">warned artists</a> not to offer unlicensed artwork of its characters in token form after one freelancer pocketed $1.85 million selling NFTs of Wonder Woman and other heroes. DC said it is exploring official token offerings of its own that will likely share revenue with artists.</li>

          <li><strong>Blockstream announced a partnership with the newly-launched Seetee</strong> to accelerate renewable energy use among bitcoin miners. The effort aims to address a problem that the electricity-intensive industry is frequently criticized for. (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/seetee-partners-with-blockstream-for-bitcoin-mining-development">Bitcoin Magazine</a>)</li>

          <li><strong>Artificial intelligence is quickly maturing as an industry unto itself.</strong> That was the <a href="https://www.axios.com/state-of-artificial-intelligence-stanford-university-f5d71c41-251e-4fb4-b9b2-89fdee48bb3c.html">jist</a> of the fourth annual <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-2021">AI Index Report</a>, published by Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI. Among this year's findings: About two-thirds of North American recipients of doctorates in AI now go to work at companies, up from 44% in 2010. Separately, a group of AI researchers has started <a href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/">a database of mishaps</a> in the growing discipline, to better avoid future incidents.</li>



          <li><strong>SUSE is going public.</strong> The enterprise Linux provider could raise up to $9.5 billion in an initial stock offering in Europe later this spring. (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-suse-ipo-idUSKBN2B12AD">Reuters</a>)</li>


          <li><strong>National Basketball Association team owners created a committee to study potential uses of blockchain.</strong> Two obvious possibilities offhand are ticketing and collectibles. (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/basketball-billionaires-form-nba-blockchain-use-case-committee">Cointelegraph</a>)</li>
