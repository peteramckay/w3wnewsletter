        <p><strong>Facebook's foray into blockchain is not going well.</strong> You can tell by its latest public-relations pivot toward a new tactic: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/business/facebook-cryptocurrency-diem-payments.html">whining</a>.</p>

        <p>When Facebook announced in 2019 its plans to launch a stablecoin called Libra, regulators freaked out, assuming the social giant would end up dominating global banking. (Some of us bystanders were, <a href="https://peteramckay.medium.com/stablecoins-are-nearly-a-6-billion-market-without-libra-d72b9723e4fe">ahem</a>, a bit more <a href="https://peteramckay.medium.com/has-facebook-built-a-better-stablecoin-with-libra-2aeea493d9f3">skeptical</a> at the time, however.)</p>

        <p>Facebook has since recalibrated its plan significantly, supporting development of the open-source token <a href="https://www.diem.com/en-us/">Diem</a> in lieu of Libra. It's also now planning a digital wallet dubbed <a href="https://www.novi.com/">Novi</a>. But none of this has actually launched, because regulators still hate Facebook.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, other stablecoins like Tether and USDC have exploded in popularity. The category now regularly tops $100 billion in daily trading, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

        <p>Which all apparently makes David Marcus, Facebook's head of financial services, quite sad. In a <a href="https://medium.com/@davidmarcus/good-stablecoins-a-protocol-for-money-and-digital-wallets-the-formula-to-fix-our-broken-payment-f11f59fc92d7">blog post</a> Wednesday, he said Facebook just wants a "fair shot" in the digital currency space, where it is "a challenger," not the dominant player.</p>

        <p>Factually, he's 100% correct about that last part. But as a matter of principle, he still shouldn't expect anyone to give one whit about it, especially the democratic governments and smaller companies Facebook has wantonly undermined for years.</p>

        <p>Want fairness? There's an old expression about something that fits the bill: turnabout.</p>

        <p>The week's other headlines:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>The crypto market's global valuation</strong> topped <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cryptocurrency-market-tops-2t-for-first-time-since-may">$2 trillion</a> for the first time since May.</strong> Much of the gain was driven by bitcoin, which posted a 7-day gain of nearly 7% aided by fresh <a href="https://app.blockdata.tech/blog/general/banks-investing-blockchain-companies">institutional buying</a>. The token enters the new week within reach of reclaiming two previous round-number milestones -- a $50,000 price per token and a $1 trillion total market cap.</li>

          <li><strong>Vitalik Buterin says DeFi should upgrade its governance.</strong> In a new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-states-token-based-decentralized-governance-stops-defi-sector-from-growing/">blog post</a>, Ethereum's founder said "proof of humanity" or "proof of participation" might be <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-states-token-based-decentralized-governance-stops-defi-sector-from-growing/">better ways</a> to run decentralized finance networks than the strict coin-based voting process that's now common.</li>

          <li><strong>Walmart is looking for a digital currencies lead.</strong> A new job posting signals that the retail giant is pondering possible moves into digital payments or other offerings, according to <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/news/walmart-lists-new-job-for-a-cryptocurrency-product-lead">TheStreet</a>'s Luke Conway.</li>

          <li><strong>Coinbase has built a $4 billion cash reserve</strong> to weather a possible new "crypto winter," the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coinbase-builds-a-4-billion-cash-pile-ahead-of-possible-regulatory-tightening-11629295200?mod=hp_lista_pos4">reports</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Binance tapped its chief financial officer</strong> to be CEO of the exchange's U.S. operations. The move <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/113960/binanceus-picks-cfo-to-helm-exchange-after-abrupt-brian-brooks-exit">follows the abrupt departure</a> on Aug. 6 of Brian Brooks, who cited conflict among senior management over strategy.</li>

          <li><strong>Hackers stole nearly $100 million in tokens from Liquid</strong>, a Japanese exchange. The exchange said it is working with authorities to recover the money, though that may prove difficult, Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/japanese-exchange-liquid-loses-over-90-million-in-crypto-heist/">reports</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Microsoft researchers published</strong> a new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/08/Argus_SRDS_Camera.pdf">whitepaper</a> detailing Argus, their idea for an Ethereum-based system to combat piracy of intellectual property online.</strong></li>

          <li><strong>It's getting harder to buy Apple's pro-privacy sales pitch</strong>, says the New York Times' Greg Bensinger in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/opinion/apple-iphone-privacy.html">new column</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Bitcoin for everyone!</strong> Mayor Jayson Stewart of Cool Valley, Mo. (population: 1,500) wants to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/u-s-mayor-wants-to-give-everyone-1000-in-bitcoin/">give every resident $1,000 in bitcoin</a> on condition they not sell it. Stewart <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/u-s-mayor-wants-to-give-everyone-1000-in-bitcoin/">tells Bitcoinist</a> he envisions a trust-fund like structure to build community wealth over time in the small town. Hmmm...</li>
