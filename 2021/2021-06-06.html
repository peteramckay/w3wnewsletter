        <h4>May 30 - June 5, 2021</h4></span>

        <br>

        <p><strong>May was an extraordinary time for crypto, mostly for the worse.</strong> But now that we have month-end data in hand, there were a few highlights as well.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin's monthly decline for May (37.5%) was its second-worst plunge ever, topped only by a dismal September 2011 (down 40%), <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-eyes-second-biggest-monthly-drop-on-record">according to CoinDesk</a>. June is off to a more promising start, though, with BTC showing a weekly gain of about 3% as of late Saturday.</p>

        <p>Ether was off 12% in May, but on-chain volume and miner revenue <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106827/multiple-eth-records-miner-revenue-on-chain-volume-broken-may">hit new records</a>. The Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade is also progressing, with more than 5 million ETH now staked to the new system's deposit contract, The Block <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106721/more-than-5-million-eth-has-been-sent-to-ethereum-2-0s-deposit-contract">reports</a>.</p>

        <p>Decentralized finance (or DeFi for short) continued to be a big driver of Ethereum activity. Such protcols generated a record <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106858/defi-protocols-ethereum-may-revenue">$370 million in revenue</a> in May. And, of course, non-fungible tokens also continue to boom on Ethereum, with players like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sothebys-sell-first-nft-online-auction-2021-06-01/">Sotheby's</a> and <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/107087/crypto-exchange-ftx-nft-marketplace">FTX</a> getting more active in that category.</p>

        <p>All of this helped push global crypto exchange volume over $2 trillion in May, also a new record <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/106654/crypto-exchange-volume-2-trillion-may-highest-history">according to The Block</a>. So it would seem participation is continuing to expand among individual investors and big institutions alike.</p>

        <p>The week's other headlines:</p>


        <ul>

          <li><strong>Miami is flexing its new blockchain cred.</strong> The city <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/technology/miami-worship-bitcoin.html">hosted the Bitcoin 2021 conference</a> this weekend, the world's first major <a href="https://b.tc/conference/agenda">in-person crypto gathering</a> since the COVID pandemic started. Coincidentally, Miami also got some welcome corporate news, boosting Mayor Francis Suarez's recent push to turn the city into a crypto hub. The exchange Blockchain.com announced it will <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article251865648.html">move its headquarters</a> from New York to Miami. And Borderless Capital <a href="https://decrypt.co/72532/miami-crypto-aspirations-boosted-borderless-capitals-25-million-fund">launched</a> a $25 million investment fund for digital payments projects in Miami.</li>

          <li><strong>Coinbase rolled out some big additions.</strong> The exchange <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinbase-now-allows-dogecoin-trading/ar-AAKIpKI">listed Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-debit-card-now-works-with-apple-pay">integrated</a> its crypto-backed debit cards with Apple Pay.</li>

          <li><strong>Meanwhile, trading competitor eToro</strong> reported that it <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/gamestop-and-crypto-drive-bumper-quarter-for-online-broker-etoro-20210603">added 3.1 million users</a> in the first quarter. Nice!</li>

          <li><strong>U.S. authorities are ramping up ransomware enforcement.</strong> The Department of Justice will begin giving such investigations similar priority to terrorism cases, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-us-give-ransomware-hacks-similar-priority-terrorism-official-says-2021-06-03/">reports</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission sued five individuals</strong> in connection with Bitconnect's 2018 collapse. The major U.S. market regulator <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-sues-5-over-2b-bitconnect-ponzi">alleges</a> that the exchange was a $2 billion Ponzi scheme.</li>

          <li><strong>AMC became a full-blown meme stock.</strong> No word from the SEC on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-02/amc-extends-advance-in-postmarket-trading-on-mudrick-deal?srnd=premium">that one</a> yet.</li>

          <li><strong>The Group of Seven countries reached a deal</strong> on minimum corporate taxation, in a move that could have major implications for Big Tech. Under the agreement, the world's biggest economies (with the notable exception of China) would <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/06/05/g7-tax-us-yellen/">set a minimum corporate tax rate</a> of 15% a year.</li>

          <li><strong>The Reserve Bank of India</strong> clarified <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rbi-says-banks-cant-quote-2018-circular-to-restrict-crypto-transactions">its stance</a> on whether the country's banks can offer customers crypto services. A ban issued in 2018 is no longer legally valid, RBI said.</li>

          <li><strong>Singapore's DBS Bank</strong> issued its first bond via blockchain, in a listing <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/dbs-bank-issues-blockchain-bond-as-security-token/">valued at $15 million</a>.</li>


           <li><strong>Nigeria blocked Twitter.</strong> The move appears to be retaliation for the social platform recently removing a tweet by president Muhammadu Buhari which Twitter said violated its “abusive behavior” policy. Now authorities are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520166/twitter-suspended-nigeria-delete-tweet-president-violate-rules">threatening to arrest</a> anyone caught using the service in Nigeria.</li>


          <li><strong>The Iron Sheik is a bitcoiner.</strong> I'm paraphrasing here, of course. The wrestling legend used <a href="https://twitter.com/the_ironsheik/status/1399022218148028419">somewhat more colorful language</a> to make the point in a tweet recently.</li>
