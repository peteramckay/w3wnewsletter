        <h4>July 18-24, 2021</h4></span>

        <br>

        <p><strong>Wowza, it was a crazy week.</strong> Some specifics to share:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>FTX closed the largest crypto startup funding round ever.</strong> The exchange provider <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-smashes-crypto-funding-record-with-900m-raise-to-become-exchange-decacorn">raised $900 million</a> from a who's who of more than 60 venture investors, placing the company's total valuation at $18 billion.</li>

          <li><strong>DraftKings and Autograph</strong> announced a <a href="https://decrypt.co/76453/draftkings-nft-marketplace-exclusive-home-autograph-tom-brady">new partnership</a> to offer sports collectibles as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Autograph, a startup co-founded by football star Tom Brady, also announced it was adding as advisors several high-profile athletes who presumably will now lend their likenesses to NFTs on the new platform. The new advisors are Derek Jeter, Tiger Woods, Naomi Osaka, Tony Hawk, and Wayne Gretzky,</li>

          <li><strong>Aave plans to release</strong> an Ethereum-based Twitter alternative later this year, Decrypt <a href="https://decrypt.co/76278/defi-project-aave-to-release-ethereum-based-twitter-alternative-this-year">reports</a>.</li>


          <li><strong>Bitcoin got a boost from several welcome developments.</strong> Speaking at an online conference, Elon Musk revealed for the first time that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587390/spacex-tesla-bitcoin-musk-dorsey-ethereum-dogecoin">SpaceEx owns some bitcoin</a>. He also said environmental concerns around the token are receding to a point that his electric-car company, Tesla, will soon resume accepting bitcoin payments. Separately, bitcoin mining <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-makes-history-as-btc-records-fourth-consecutive-negative-mining-difficulty-adjustment-202107190253">got measurably easier</a> for the fourth week in a row as companies formerly based in China relaunched in friendlier jurisdictions. The string of bullish news pushed bitcoin above $34,000, up 8% for the week through Saturday evening. The token also won over a new high-profile fan -- rapper <a href="https://twitter.com/BustaRhymes/status/1418210681812242442">Busta Rhymes</a>.</li>



          <li><strong>Grayscale and CoinDesk are partnering</strong> to launch a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/07/19/grayscale-ceo-on-crypto-partnership-launch-of-defi-fund-index.html">new decentralized finance  index</a> and an investment fund pegged to it.</li>



          <li><strong>Wall Street continues to add crypto on-ramps for old-school investors.</strong> JP Morgan will now <a href="https://decrypt.co/76645/jp-morgan-wealth-clients-exposure-bitcoin-ethereum-funds">allow</a> its advisors to buy and sell crypto products on behalf of wealth-management clients. Bank of America <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-america-approves-bitcoin-futures-trading-for-some-clients-sources">approved</a> bitcoin futures trading for some clients. MasterCard is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-to-test-usdc-for-payments-as-stablecoin-scrutiny-intensifies">testing</a> the USDC stablecoin as a potential bridge between traditional and blockchain-based payment accounts. And Circle, the company that leads USDC development, <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/greater-transparency-for-usdc-reserves">released new details</a> about reserves backing the token.</li>

          <li><strong>Meanwhile, regulators are building speed bumps and roadblocks.</strong> State regulators in New Jersey, Texas, and Alabama <a href="https://thecoininsiders.com/2021/07/regulators-in-three-us-states-close-in-on-blockfis-cryptocurrency-accounts/">took action against BlockFi</a>, alleging its crypto offerings constitute uregistered securities. Robinhood's crypto division said it expects to pay a $30 million settlement to New York regulators following their investigation of its cybersecurity and anti-money laundering controls. In Washington, the new chairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission said some stablecoins may legally <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-hints-some-stablecoins-are-securities">qualify as securities</a>. The chief U.S. regulator of credit unions <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-credit-union-regulator-wants-to-know-how-its-firms-handle-defi">requested information from its regulated entities</a> about how they might interact with blockchain networks, especially decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Oversease, Turkey has a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/turkey-plans-to-present-law-on-cryptocurrencies-in-october-report">new crypto law</a> in the works that includes minimum capital requirements among its provisions.</li>

          <li><strong>Thorchain suffered a $5 million hack.</strong> Leaders of the community-based DeFi platform said they'll <a href="https://decrypt.co/76215/thorchain-tapping-treasury-repay-5m-ethereum-after-attack">pay victims back</a> out of the project's treasury holdings.</li>


          <li><strong>The New York Times published an op-ed</strong> by Cornell University economics professor Eswar Prasad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/opinion/cash-digital-currency-central-bank.html">arguing</a> that the U.S. should adopt a digital dollar.</li>


          <li><strong>Podcaster Laura Shin</strong> did a <a href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-ransomware-evolved-into-a-big-business/">solid episode</a> on how ransomware became a business model for some unscrupulous hackers.</li>

          <li><strong>Israel’s NSO Group cracked the iPhone's security protections.</strong> The company's Pegasus spyware has been used to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/">hack the cellphones</a> of thousands of journalists, activists, and dignitaries around the world, The Washington Post <a href="hack cellphones of journalists, activists worldwide">reports</a>.</li>



          <li><strong>Some fun at Jeff Bezos's expense.</strong> Slate asked the <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/bezos-blue-origin-resembles-penis-rocket-scientist-explains-why.html">obvious but uncomfortable</a> question about the rocket he recently rode into space. Let's just say the ship drew comparisons to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYSOmYyNHpU">similar one</a> flown by the fictional Austin Powers nemesis Dr. Evil. Meanwhile, there's a <a href="https://twitter.com/acityinohio/status/1418704875026882563">cheeky cover letter</a> waiting on the Amazon founder's desk for the company's new senior blockchain opening.</li>
