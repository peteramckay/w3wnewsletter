        <p><strong>I had seriously mixed emotions</strong> reading about the latest <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/business/media/medium-editorial-buyout.html">cutbacks at Medium</a>.</p>

        <p>The platform announced on Tuesday it is slashing budgets and offering across-the-board buyouts to employees at the several branded publications it's been hosting the last few years. These include titles such as <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/">OneZero</a> and <a href="https://zora.medium.com/">Zora</a>.</p>

        <p>Now it can be told: When Medium was first building its stable of in-house titles, I had preliminary conversations with them about doing <em>this</em> very publication with them. But I ultimately decided not to go with Medium because I'd have to give up my own <a href="https://w3w.news">website</a> and email distribution in order to give them exclusivity.</p>

        <p>In that context, I feel like I dodged a bullet with this latest news from Medium. On the other hand, my heart always goes out to the affected employees in situations like this, of course. It feels very much like a gazillion rounds of layoffs we've seen at legacy media organizations the last few decades.</p>

        <p>Which brings us to the more imporant point. Look, I have nothing against Medium personally. I still maintain a <a href="https://peteramckay.medium.com/">personal account</a> there, which I use primarily to cross-post the newsletter content <em>once it's gone out on my own channels</em>. But I emphasize the big qualifier there.</p>

        <p>I'm simply not going to give up a certain baseline level of editorial independence to <em>any</em> platform given the long-term disaster that strategy has proven to be for the media business in general. I feel like we should all have learned that by now.</p>

        <p>The week's other headlines:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Crypto payments got a boost from two major companies.</strong> PayPal enabled a feature called <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-03-30-A-New-Way-to-Use-Cryptocurrency-at-Millions-of-Businesses-Checkout-with-Crypto-from-PayPal">Checkout with Crypto</a> that enables users to sell cryptocurrencies through PayPal to fund select online purchases in U.S. dollars as part of the PayPal app's regular checkout flow. Meanwhile, Visa said it will <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/visa-moves-allow-payment-settlements-using-cryptocurrency-rcna534">begin allowing the use of USD Coin</a>, a stablecoin pegged to the greenback, to settle transactions on its network.</li>

          <li><strong>Venture money is flooding into non-fungible token startups.</strong> CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/michael-jordan-joins-305m-investment-in-firm-behind-nba-top-shot">reports</a> that basketball legend Michael Jordan was among the investors in a $305 million funding round recently completed by Dapper Labs, which has built the sports collectible platform NBA Top Shot. Separately, Enjin raised <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/99980/enjin-polkadot-based-blockchain-nft-funding">nearly $19 million</a> to build a Polkadot-based blockchain for NFTs. SuperRare, a marketplace for NFTs, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/99869/nft-marketplace-superrare-funding-round">raised $9 million</a> in Series A funding. And its rival Zora Labs <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/zora-gets-in-on-nft-funding-craze-with-8m-raise-sec-documents-show">raised $8 million</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Crypto markets hit set new round-number milestones, with one big one yet to go.</strong> Bitcoin topped $60,000 for the first time, and Ethereum rose above $2,000. But the $2 trillion mark for global market capitalization in crypto remained just out of reach for now, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">data from CoinMarketCap</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Tether confirmed its stablecoin was fully backed by asset reserves as of late February.</strong> The company published a <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tether-assurance-feb-2021.pdf">reassurance report</a> by its accounting firm, Moore Cayman, to assuage a frequent criticism of its USDT token pegged to the U.S. dollar. Moore Cayman said Tether does indeed have over $35 billion in assets on hand, in line with the market cap of USDT as of Feb. 28.</li>

          <li><strong>Brave got some welcome mainstream media love.</strong> New York Times consumer tech columnist Brian X. Chen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/technology/personaltech/online-privacy-private-browsers.html">recommended</a> that raeders try Brave's privacy-focused web browser as an alternative to Big Tech offerings like Chrome, Edge, and Safari.</li>

          <li><strong>Regulators took action against LBRY.</strong> The Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://decrypt.co/63319/sec-sues-lbry-over-11-million-in-token-sales">sued the blockchain-based publishing platform</a>, claiming it should have registered tokens it sold as a securities offering.</li>

          <li><strong>Coinbase's direct listing</strong> of its shares on Nasdaq is now <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/100235/coinbase-direct-listing-april-nasdaq">scheduled for April 14</a>.</li>


          <li><strong>Microsoft made some big moves into emerging technologies.</strong> The giant <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/31/microsoft-army-augmented-reality/">won a $21 billion government contract</a> to build augmented reality headsets for the U.S. military. It also <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/03/20359787/microsoft-launches-decentralized-identity-platform-ion-on-bitcoins-blockchain">launched</a> a new decentralized identity platform, dubbed ION, on the Bitcoin network.</li>

          <li><strong>Telcom lobbying has taken some weird and/or evil turns lately.</strong> AT&T has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/att-lobbies-against-nationwide-fiber-says-10mbps-uploads-are-good-enough/">making the case</a> to government officials in the U.S. <em>against</em> nationwide fiberoptic internet service, and Ericsson is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ban-on-huawei-helped-revive-ericsson-but-landed-ceo-in-a-tough-spot-11617204414?mod=hp_lead_pos4">going to bat</a> for its rival Huawei. You know, like you do when you're tooootally not an oligopoly.</li>

          <li><strong>Saturday Night Live skewered NFTs.</strong> The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc">skit</a> was not only hilarious but also a surprisingly accurate explainer. Just listen to Guy With Mop.</li>
