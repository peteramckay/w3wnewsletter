	<p>The latest headlines about decentralization:</p>


        <ul>

		<li><strong>Crypto markets saw new records and round-number milestones all around.</strong> Bitcoin's market capitalization <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/bitcoin-steams-new-record-hits-1-trillion-market-cap-n1258345">topped $1 trillion</a> for the first time as it neared $58,000 per token. Nevertheless, its share of the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">global crypto market</a> has actually slipped from about 70% at the start of 2021 to 60% now as altcoins' gains have been even more rapid. Ether has led the way among alts, setting a new all-time high above $2,000 last week. Those gains have helped push the valuation of the global crypto market within reach of $2 trillion.</li>



	<li><strong>Canada launched an exchange-traded fund tracking bitcoin.</strong> The Purpose Bitcoin ETF, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, saw more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-21/raging-success-of-first-bitcoin-fund-shows-who-leads-etf-market">$400 million in trading volume</a> in its first two days of availability. Wall Street watched the successful launch with some envy as the Securities and Exchange commission has so far been hesitant to approve similar bitcoin-related ETFs in the U.S.</li>


		<li><strong>MetaMask added a browser feature to its mobile app.</strong> The addition effectively gives iDevice and Android users <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/discover-blockchain-apps-with-metamask-mobile-b0fb090425f7">easier access</a> to blockchain-based apps, games, and other products.</li>


	<li><strong>New details emerged about recent tensions between tech titan Jack Ma and China's government.</strong> The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-blocked-jack-mas-ant-ipo-after-an-investigation-revealed-who-stood-to-gain-11613491292?st=tei2ye04f4lopii&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter">reports</a> that regulators recently blocked the initial stock offering of Ma's company, the Ant Group, after uncovering a surprisingly complex ownership structure. It included offshore investments by individuals viewed as potential political threats to Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinpging.</li>


	<li><strong>Coinbase facilitated Tesla's big bitcoin buy.</strong> The exchange quietly executed the carmaker's $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin during the first week of February, according to <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/95146/coinbase-tesla-bitcoin-buy">The Block</a>. The move exemplifies Coinbase's push to attract big institutional customers looking to get involved in crypto for the first time.</li>

		<li><strong>Christie's said it will accept ether as a form of payment for an upcoming digital art auction.</strong> Noah Davis, the Christieâ€™s specialist whoâ€™s organized the sale, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/christie-s-beeple-auction-will-accept-ether-cryptocurrency-payment">told Bloomberg News</a> it's a way for the venerable British auction house to "dip its toe" in crypto.</li>


		<li><strong>Minneapolis banned facial recognition software by police.</strong> The move by the city council was hailed as <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-passes-restrictive-ban-on-facial-recognition-use-by-police-others/600022551/">a victory</a> for privacy advocates and people of color. Other cities have enacted similar laws recently, including Portland, Ore., Boston, and Alameda, Calif.</li>


		<li><strong>NASA's new rover took the first ever selfie from another world.</strong> After landing on Mars on Thursday, Perseverance sent back the first <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/19/world/mars-rover-new-images-scn-trnd/index.html">full-color images</a> from the planet's surface, including one of itself with the camera positioned at a distance. Sound familiar?</li>
