        <h4>Sept. 19-25, 2021</h4></span>

        <br>

        <p><strong>Seems the world's two biggest economic powers</strong> are getting more concerned about crypto as competition to their own money printing.</p>

        <p>Take China, which is in the process of launching its own national digitial currency. No coincidence, the country's ruling party just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html">banned all other crypto trading</a>.</p>

        <p>The good news is China has previously issued similar bans on paper, with spotty followup and enforcement each time. But this new one may <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/24/chinas-latest-crypto-ban-is-its-most-severe-insiders-say/">get more traction</a> given the regime's own advancing currency plans.</p>

        <p>In the U.S., Wall Street banks have clearly made an uneasy peace with crypto as a potential source of new profits. Many have launched new crypto products for customers, launched proprietary trading, or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-oppose-strict-basel-rules-targeting-crypto-currencies-11632228967">spoken out</a> against restrictive new rules.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the government has been a different story. Federal regulators' remarks about crypto have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/21/sec-gensler-crypto-stablecoins/">gotten testier</a> of late, even as the Federal Reserve is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/the-fed-is-evaluating-whether-to-launch-a-digital-currency-and-in-what-form-powell-says.html">pondering</a> whether to launch its own digital currency.</p>

        <p>Who says the U.S. and China can't agree on anything these days?</p>

        <p>The week's other headlines:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Worries about the Chinese economy hammered markets</strong>, including conventional assets and token prices alike. In addition to the country's new crypto ban, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/what-evergrande-chinese-property-giant-behind-global-selloff-fears-n1279929">problems emerged</a> at Shenzen-based real estate giant Evergrande Group that raised concerns about Chinese growth overall. And the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/xi-jinping-aims-to-rein-in-chinese-capitalism-hew-to-maos-socialist-vision-11632150725?mod=hp_lead_pos4">reported</a> that the Chinese Communist Party under Chairman Xi Xinping is increasingly trying to reign in the power of the private sector in general as a counterweight to core socialist principles. Amid those headwinds, bitcoin suffered a 7-day decline of 9%, and global crypto market cap was off 11% to just below $2 trillion as of midday Sunday, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">CoinMarketCap data</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Investors seem mostly unfazed for now, though.</strong> A very, very <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Weekly/status/1440291856978378755">informal poll</a> I did on Twitter suggests only about a quarter of them are spooked enough to go back to index funds.</li>

          <li><strong>El Salvador seized the dip</strong> as an opportunity to buy 150 bitcoins <a href="https://decrypt.co/81302/el-salvador-buys-bitcoin-dip-top-coins-tumble">for its national treasury</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Theater chain AMC</strong> said it will <a href="https://decrypt.co/81203/meme-stock-amc-accepting-crypto-but-not-dogecoin">begin accepting</a> bitcoin, ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash as payment for movie tickets and concessions by the end of the year.</li>

          <li><strong>Twitter</strong> rolled out <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/23/you-can-now-get-paid-in-bitcoin-to-use-twitter.html">bitcoin tipping</a> for content creators.</li>

          <li><strong>Dapper Labs</strong> raised a new funding round valuing the startup at $7.6 billion, according to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/22/dapper-labs-said-to-reach-76b-valuation-in-250m-funding-round/">CoinDesk</a>. The company develops non-fungible tokens for the National Basketball Association and other clients.</li>


          <li><strong>Fortune magazine and the artist pplpleasr</strong> donated over $650,000 from their recent auction of magazine covers rendered as NFTs to <a href="https://decrypt.co/81358/ethereum-nft-sales-yield-over-650k-for-journalistic-causes">four journalism nonprofits</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>The Texas Blockchain Summit</strong> is coming up on <a href="https://texasblockchainsummit.org/">Oct. 8</a> in Austin.</li>

          <li><strong>A North Carolina ad agency</strong> took a decidedly "meta" approach to encouraging COVID vaccination. The fictional <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/truck-funeral-home-says-dont-165820632.html">Wilmore Funeral Home</a> wants you <em>not</em> to get your shots, apparently.</li>
