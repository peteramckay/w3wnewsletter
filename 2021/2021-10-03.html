        <h4>Sept. 26 to Oct. 2, 2021</h4></span>

        <br>

        <p><strong>The crypto market certainly finished</strong> the third quarter <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/01/bitcoin-climbs-above-47k-ignoring-stock-market-weakness-feds-preferred-measure-of-inflation-eyed/">with a bang</a> last week. Heck, token prices have so much momentum lately that even JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamie-dimon-bitcoin-is-a-fraud/">"fraud"</a> back in 2017, is  <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/jpmorgan-ceo-says-bitcoin-price-could-rise-10x-but-still-won-t-buy-it">guardedly</a> changing his tune now.</p>

        <p>As we head into year-end, this is also a good time to check how crypto has performed so far in 2021 compared to other assets. Here's the rundown through Saturday:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>S&P 500:</strong> +16%</li>
          <li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> +63%</li>
          <li><strong>Ether:</strong> +361%</li>
          <li><strong>Global Crypto Market Cap:</strong> +180%</li>
          <li><strong>US Dollar Index:</strong> +5%</li>
          <li><strong>Gold:</strong> -7%</li>
          <li><strong>Crude Oil:</strong> +56%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I love to "zoom out" like this periodically, as most other crypto press tends to focus on very short-term market moves. On a longer timescale, it becomes obvious crypto is having another banner year so far, helped by increased interest from both retail buyers and Wall Street.</p>

        <p>It also strikes me that the outsize gains in ether and other altcoins versus bitcoin in 2021 so far bespeak an increasing focus on blockchain as a software platform, not just a currency mint. That vision is really at the heart of the Web 3.0 movement, so it's good to see it gaining some market validation.</p>

        <p>We'll see how things go through year-end, when I'll be sure to update the scoreboard again. In the meantime, let's get to some headlines: </p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>A transaction for $100,000 in ether</strong> ran up a network fee of <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/118753/bitfinex-just-spent-23-7-million-in-fees-to-make-one-ethereum-transaction">$23.7 million</a>, initialy paid by the exchange Bitfinex. The miner that validated the transaction, DeversiFi, agreed to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/a-crypto-exchange-accidentally-paid-a-24-million-fee-for-a-100000-ethereum-transaction-but-the-miner-agreed-to-return-it/ar-AAOUWLz">return the fee</a> as a show of goodwill. But the incident highlighted users' persistent frustration with high transaction costs, known as gas fees, on the Ethereum network.</li>

          <li><strong>Visa</strong> published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2109/2109.12194.pdf">whitepaper</a> for a "universal payments channel" to make privately issued stablecoins and central bank digital currencies interoperable. The project aims to <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/visa-to-accelerate-crypto-mainstream-adoption-with-new-universal-payments-channel-202109301328">promote adoption</a> of blockchain-based payments for everyday purchases.</li>

          <li><strong>Twitter is working on new features</strong> to enable users to add non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to their accounts on the social network. Software developer Mada Aflak <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/twitter-demos-potential-ethereum-nft-verification-feature/ar-AAP03bj">unveiled Twitter's initial experiment</a> with the new functionality.</li>

          <li><strong>The decentralized finance platform Compound</strong> erroneously payed out $80 million in its COMP governance tokens <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/01/compound-founder-says-80m-bug-presents-moral-dilemma-for-defi-users/">due to a software bug</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Coin Center,</strong> a crypto research and advocacy nonprofit, wrote a blistering <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/open-blockchains-and-decentralized-identity-standards/">open letter</a> to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on distributed identity. It said development of open-source digital identifiers for users is being "being waylaid by the objections of centralized digital identity providers" like Google and Facebook. It also accused a fellow nonprofit, the Mozilla Foundation, of raising "irrelevant" concerns about the environmental impact of blockchain-based identity.</li>

          <li><strong>The Telos Foundation livestreamed</strong> a comprehensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep2-cYEEGFA">update</a> on development of its own Ethereum Virtual Machine. Release of the new EVM, which is designed to offer compatibility with Ethereum-based apps at lower transaction cost, now looks imminent. (Disclosure: I've done consulting work for the Telos Foundation in the past.)</li>

          <li><strong>Ozy Media shut down amid a brewing financial scandal.</strong> The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/01/business/media/ozy-media-carlos-watson.html">reports</a> that the company's chief operating officer impersonated a YouTube executive during a pitch to Goldman Sachs for $40 million in funding. Wow.</li>

          <li><strong>In the world of NFTs</strong>, it seems a Warhol or Pollock artwork isn't worth as much as... a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/01/gary-vaynerchuk-doodle-outsells-warhol-pollock-neel-and-more-at-christies-auction/">Vanyerchuck</a>?</li>
        </ul>
