        <p><strong>Some major personal news to pass along today:</strong> I will be joining <a href="https://capsule.social">Capsule Social</a> as Head of Content & Writer Development, starting Thursday.</p>

        <p>Capsule is all about decentralized discourse and empowering creators. They're building a newsletter platform that leverages blockchain technology both for censorship-resistant hosting of content and for payments. (Writers will also be able to charge readers the old-fashioned way if they prefer.) The software is currently in private alpha, with public launch planned for January.</p>
          Â 
        <p>For further details, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlzLMf0WdVw">this YouTube update</a> the team recently shot during an all-hands gathering in Paris. There has also been some good third-party coverage of the company by TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/cryptocat-author-gets-insanely-fast-backing-to-build-p2p-tech-for-social-media/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/capsule-gets-1-5m-to-build-super-simple-decentralized-social-media/">here</a>:</p>

        <p>As a subscriber to this newsletter, you know that these problems Capsule is working to solve in the content economy are dear to my heart. During my days as a reporter at the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, I saw firsthand the collateral damage that our current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FM5bksrImg&t=70s">Death Star-sized</a> corporate tech platforms caused to journalism in particular. Plus there is growing public concern about all sorts of other unintended harms created by Big Tech, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/teens-instagram-feed-mental-health/">undermining teens' mental health</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689559/facebook-rohingya-myanmar-official-data-order-gambia-genocide-trial">facilitating genocide</a> and on and on.</p>

        <p>We urgently need new ways to share information with one another. Ones that are fairer, more transparent, and more humane. That's exactly what Capsule is building, and I am beyond excited to help them do it.</p>

        <p>In my new role, I'll lead the team that crafts Capsule's messaging as a company, and I'll be recruiting a diverse cohort of writers to publish their own newsletters on the new platform. We're looking for journalists, artists, scientists, hobbyists, and anyone else who wants to share their passion with engaged readers.</p>Â 

        <p>If that describes you, please drop me an email at peter[at]capsule.social. Let's talk. ðŸ˜‰</p>

        <p>Now, some headlines from elsewhere:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Facebook did indeed change its name,</strong> as <a href="https://peteramckay.medium.com/whatever-they-call-it-facebook-will-still-suck-b167e64d8ec">expected</a> due to earlier leaks. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/Meta/status/1453795115701440524">announced</a> it will now call itself Meta, reflecting its increasing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand">focus on augmented reality</a>, or the "metaverse".</li>

          <li><strong>Over $2 billion in ether tokens</strong> have been burned since the network <a href="https://decrypt.co/84221/over-2b-in-ethereum-has-now-been-burned-by-eip-1559">implemented a new monetary policy</a> in August. As the Ethereum network transitions to a proof-of-stake consensus method, the shrinkage of supply may grow even more pronounced, Decrypt <a href="https://decrypt.co/84520/ethereum-supply-pace-shrink-eth-2-upgrade">reports</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Bitcoiners are celebrating the 13th anniversary</strong> of Satoshi Nakamoto's <a href="http://satoshinakamoto.me/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a>, published on Oct. 31, 2008. Satoshi, who used a pseudonym to document his idea for the Bitcoin network, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-that-indicate-bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-wont-ever-come-back/">has not been heard from publicly</a> in 10 years, curiously.</li>

          <li><strong>El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender continues in fits and starts.</strong> Identity thieves have been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/29/identity-thieves-exploit-el-salvadors-chivo-bitcoin-wallets-setup-process/">swiping some users' accounts</a> on Chivo, an official wallet where the government is using to airdrop every citizen $30 in bitcoin. Separately, the country's Treasury seized a <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1453461587948445697">seized</a> a market pullback Wednesday as an opportunity to buy about $25 million worth of additional BTC.</li>

          <li><strong>Coinbase reached the number-one spot in Apple's mobile App Store.</strong> Rising public interest in crypto has also boosted the popular exchange's app on Google Play, where it recently hit number-two among free apps, Decrypt <a href="https://decrypt.co/84653/coinbase-returns-to-no-1-in-apple-us-app-store">reports</a>.</p>

          <li><strong>The New York Times</strong> ran a nice <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/us/politics/crypto-currency-venture-capitalists.html">explainer</a> covering how blockchain might disrupt various industries in the next few years.</li>

          <li><strong>Decentralized gaming is heating up.</strong> GameStop is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2767078769/">looking to hire</a> a "Head of Web3 Gaming" who has experience with Ethereum, non-fungible tokens, and blockchain-based gaming platforms. Meanwhile, Valve angered developers recently by booting several blockchain-based games from its Linux-based Steam platform. In response, 26 blockchain gaming companies penned an <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/valve-web3-games-have-a-place-on-steam/">open letter</a> to Valve pleading for it to reverse course.</li>

          <li><strong>Near Protocol is offering $800 million in grants</strong> to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/25/near-protocol-offers-800m-in-grants-in-bid-for-defi-mindshare/">encourage building of decentralized finance applications</a> on its network.</li>

          <li><strong>Yearn developer Matt West</strong> is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/18/defi-on-the-ballot-yearn-developer-matt-west-is-running-for-congress/">running for Congress</a> in the U.S.</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Windows XP marked its 20th anniversary.</strong> About 8 million computers still run the operating system despite Microsoft's decision to end support for it in 2014, according to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-xp-turns-20-why-its-time-to-say-goodbye">Tech Radar</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Reminder:</strong> NASA flew a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/linux-is-now-on-mars-thanks-to-nasas-perseverance-rover">drone that runs Linux</a> on Mars earlier this year. Just saying.</li>

        </ul>
