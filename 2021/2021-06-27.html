        <h4>June 20-26, 2021</h4></span>

        <br>

        <p><strong>The love-hate is strong in blockchain world right now.</strong> It's clear newbies and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/elon-musk-tourist-in-crypto-space-celsius-network-ceo-says-2021-6-1030496407?op=1">tourists</a> are still spooked, but big institutions are building for a bright future over the longer term. Meawhile, government attitudes are all over the place depending on jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>The latest headlines:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Money is flowing out of crypto at the fastest pace since 2018.</strong> Digital assets suffered three straight weeks of investment outflows through June 21. That was the longest slide in more than three years, according to a <a href="https://medium.com/coinshares/vol-34-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-f3b27a18a063">new analysis</a> from CoinShares. Global crypto market cap has tumbled to $1.3 trillion, down from a record over $2.4 trillion in May. Bitcoin posted a weekly decline of 7%, trading around $33,000 early Sunday.</li>

          <li><strong>China's continued crackdown on bitcoin mining is a big part of the problem.</strong> Sichuan province, a key mining hub, shut down 26 more miners. The move pushed the network's hashrate, or pace of minting new bitcoins, down by almost one-fifth during the week, according to <a href="https://decrypt.co/74075/bitcoin-hashrate-falls-17-overnight-after-china-mining-crackdown">The Block</a>.</li>


          <li><strong>But Wall Street continues to launch new crypto offerings.</strong> Goldman Sachs has begun <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/bitcoin-goldman-sachs-ramps-up-trading-in-partnership-with-mike-novogratz-galaxy-digital.html">trading bitcoin futures</a> through a partnership with Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital. Meanwhile, rival Citigroup <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/109526/citigroup-digital-asset-unit">launched a new digital asset unit</a> within its wealth management division. And crypto exchanges like Binance and FTX are moving into <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ftx-follows-binances-lead-with-move-into-tokenized-stocks">tokenized stocks</a>, including on-chain versions of shares in Facebook, Google, Netflix, and more.</li>

          <li><strong>Polkadot was a rare market highlight as it listed on Coinbase.</strong> The smart-contract platform's eponymous token <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polkadot-on-coinbase-went-up-more-than-70-in-the-midst-of-crypto-market-sell-off">jumped 70%</a> in its initial hours of trading.</li>

          <li><strong>New York's leading mayoral candidate</strong> wants the Big Apple to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/odds-on-mayor-favorite-will-make-nyc-bitcoin-center-issues-m-10814.htm">embrace bitcoin</a>. Watch out, Miami!</li>
