        <br>

        <p><strong>Does anyone on the internet</strong> even understand what free speech is anymore?</p>

        <p>I know it's common these days to bellyache about this issue anytime a social network temporarily suspends a single loon claiming aliens put computer chips in the COVID vaccine. But that's not what I'm talking about here. The number of worrisome anti-speech actions by goverments and Big Tech crammed into the past week was truly above and beyond:</p>

        <ul>

           <li><strong>LinkedIn said it will shut down its flagship service in China</strong> because of onerous "compliance" requirements. Translation: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/technology/linkedin-china-microsoft.html">Censorship</a> by the Communist Party. Sadly, the move validates the approach of other U.S. tech companies that have reluctantly stayed out of China altogether to avoid making stomach-churning compromises on users' rights.</li>

           <li><strong>Missouri's governor threatened to sue</strong> the state's biggest newspaper for "hacking" because it reported on an egregious security bug on a government website. Reporters <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/missouri-gov-calls-journalist-who-found-security-flaw-a-hacker-threatens-to-sue/">found this bug</a> by -- gasp! -- inspecting the site's HTML code in their web browsers.</li>

           <li><strong>YouTube briefly de-platformed Anthony Pompliano, a popular podcaster covering bitcoin.</strong> His channel was at first deleted, ostensibly because Pomp was encouraging <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1447629947284099077/photo/1">unspecified</a> "illegal activities." Then he was <a href="https://beincrypto.com/youtube-anthony-pomplianos-harmful-dangerous-crypto-channel/">reinstated</a> after an uproar from fans. An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytmhmixeCRo">interview</a> he did with market analyst PlanB seemed to be a particular flashpoint in the controversey.</li>

           <li><strong>Apple fired Janneke Parrish</strong>, a program manager on Apple Maps who's organized an anti-discrimination movement within the company dubbed #AppleToo. The move immediately spawned <a href="https://twitter.com/JannekeParrish/status/1449066853314224129">accusations of retaliation</a>, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/15/apple-janneke-parrish-fired-appletoo">Apple denies</a>, of course.</li>

           <li><strong>A firestorm erupted at Netflix over Dave Chappelle's jokes about LGBT people.</strong> This one is so complicated, I'll just recommend the excellent <a href="https://time.com/6105951/dave-chappelle-netflix-controversy/">explainer</a> that Time's Andrew R. Chow wrote about it. A great starting point to understand the whole mess, which seems likely to take awhile longer to play out. Netflix management is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/ted-sarandos-says-netflix-will-not-take-down-dave-chappelle-s-the-closer/ar-AAPohET">resisting</a> activists' calls to take down Chappelle's special, and an <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trans-netflix-staff-plan-walkout-183719887.html">employee walkout</a> in protest is planned for Wednesday.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Of course, beyond the crucial matter of who ges to say what, when, and where online, we had news on a bunch of other fronts as well last week. Let's get to those headlines:</p>


        <ul>

          <li><strong>An exchange-traded fund tracking bitcoin is expected to begin trading this week.</strong> Multiple news organizations reported Friday that U.S. regulators will allow ETFs proposed by ProShares and Invesco to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/bitcoin-is-inches-away-from-reaching-60000-amid-etf-speculation.html">begin trading</a> this week. Bitcoin leapt back above $60,000 on the news, up 11% for the week. The crypto industry has long hoped for an ETF as a tool to widen bitcoin's appeal to everyday investors, who will be able to trade the ETF through traditional stock brokerage accounts.</li>

          <li><strong>Crypto startups are booming.</strong> Companies in the category raised a record $6.5 billion in <a href="https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/blockchain-companies-see-its-biggest-quarter-in-venture-funding-ever">venture investment</a> in the third quarter, according to Blockdata. Meanwhile, The Block reports that publicly listed bitcoin mining firms based in the U.S. are <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/119830/bitcoin-btc-us-mining-hold-billion">holding over $1 billion in BTC</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>FTX launched a regulated U.S. marketplace for non-fungible tokens.</strong> Unlike competing trading venues like OpenSea, FTX's new platform will allow users to buy NFTs using conventioanl bank accounts, wire transfers and cards, according to <a href="https://decrypt.co/83023/ftx-us-nft-marketplace-solana-ethereum-opensea">Decrypt</a></li>

          <li><strong>Polygon hiked its minimum transaction fee</strong>, or gas price, by <a href="https://thedefiant.io/polygon-transaction-fee-hike/">thirtyfold</a> to discourage spammers. (Of course, there's a risk this could also discourage activity that's <em>not</em> spam as well. But hey...)</li>

          <li><strong>Ripple and Nelnet</strong> launched a new joint project to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/11/ripple-teams-with-nelnet-on-44m-solar-investment/">fund solar energy projects</a> throughout the U.S.</li>

          <li><strong>Space has been a busy place lately.</strong> NASA launched a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/16/science/nasa-lucy-launch.html">robotic spacecraft</a> on a 12-year mission to study the asteroids near Jupiter that may hold hints about the origins of our solar system. Separately, Jeff Bezos's startup Blue Origin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSNXBvpLb9o">flew the actor who played Captain Kirk</a> barely over the atmospheric threshold where outer space begins, for a few minutes. Guess which one of these things is a bigger technical achievement. Guess which one got more mainstream press attention.</li>

        </ul>
