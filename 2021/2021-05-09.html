        <p><strong>Crypto is now bigger than the U.S. dollar</strong> by at least one major metric.</p>

        <p>The global valuation of cryptoassets topped $2.4 trillion last week, led by new all-time highs in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ether-sets-new-all-time-high-of-more-than-3-8k">ether</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/05/07/dogecoin-soars-past-70-cents-to-record-high-after-elon-musk-snl-tease/?sh=5d00fb731efa">dogecoin</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-bitcoin-jobs-altcoins">modest bump</a> for bitcoin. <em>That now makes the crypto market slightly bigger than the amount of paper U.S. currency in circulation</em>, at $2.2 trillion, according to data published Saturday <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-happens-to-stocks-and-cryptocurrencies-when-the-fed-stops-raining-money-11620446420?mod=hp_lead_pos7">in the Wall Street Journal</a>. (Note: WSJ's story is paywalled as usual, bless their hearts. But you can see a similar crypto-dollar comparison from veteran markets analyst Jim Bianco for free <a href="https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1391074630534840326">here</a>.)</p>

        <p>Cue crypto heads' favorite rants about inflation versus deflation, whether bitcoin will someday replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency, and so on.</p>

        <p>We should also note here that a broader measure of U.S. money supply called M2, which includes bank balances and other forms of the dollar aside from paper greenbacks, remains way bigger than crypto for now, at <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2">nearly $20 trillion</a>. But still.</p>

        <p>It's more than a little ironic that one of naysayers' favorite criticisms of crypto -- that you "can't hold it in your hands" -- is now effectively moot. By this very standard, crypto has now won. It's only the dollar's own intangible manifestations that make it bigger at this point.</p>

        <p>The rest of the week's headlines:</p>


        <ul>


          <li><strong>MetaMask usage has quintupled over the last six months.</strong> Podcaster Laura Shin recently did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcccaXjVlk0">an excellent episode</a> about how the popular wallet has benefited from the boom in altcoins.</li>

          <li><strong>Upgrades everywhere.</strong> Big technical improvements are underway for both the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/taproot-bitcoin-upgrade-improve-technology-software">Bitcoin network</a> and <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/launch-uniswap-v3/">Uniswap</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>New crypto features may be coming to your favorite fiat-based app soon.</strong> The Block <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/103617/paypal-has-held-exploratory-talks-about-launching-a-stablecoin-sources">reports</a> that PayPal is considering whether to launch <a href="">its own stablecoin</a>. In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/05/03/ebay-ceo-jamie-iannone-on-expansion-into-new-categories.html">interview with CNBC</a>, eBay's chief executive  hinted that the auction platform may add crypto payments and non-fungible token listings. The cable network also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/bitcoin-is-coming-to-hundreds-of-us-banks-says-crypto-firm-nydig-.html">reported</a> that the crypto custody firm NYDIG and Fidelity National Information Services have formed a partnership to allow Americans to buy and hold crypto in their accounts at hundreds of conventional banks.</li>

           <li><strong>The Digital Dollar Project is pushing ahead.</strong>The nonprofit said it will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/digital-dollar-project-launch-five-us-central-bank-digital-currency-pilots-2021-05-03/">launch five pilot programs</a> over the next 12 months to test potential uses of a U.S. central bank digital currency.</li>

          <li><strong>Latin America got its first crypto unicorn.</strong> CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/2-2b-bitso-becomes-first-crypto-unicorn-in-latin-america">reports</a> that Mexico's Bitso just raised a $250 million round of venture funding valuing the token exchange at $2.2 billion overall.</li>

          <li><strong>Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to do its share of crypto dealmaking as well.</strong> Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mike-novogratz-galaxy-digital-buys-bitgo-cryptocurrency-acquisition-merger-bitcoin-2021-5-1030391163">bought</a> infrastructure provider BitGo for $1.2 billion. Venture giant Andreesen Horowitz is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-to-launch-1b-crypto-venture-fund-report">launching</a> a new $1 billion crypto fund. And hip-hop legend Nas emerged as a <a href="https://t.co/SzpOx7tUb7?amp=1">big winner</a> from the recent Coinbase IPO. His early investment in the exchange soared over $40 million after its shares listed on Nasdaq.</li>

          <li><strong>Charlie Munger still hates bitcoin.</strong> Unlike some Wall Streeters who have flip-flopped recently, Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman has at least <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-success-is-disgusting-berkshires-charlie-munger">remained consistent</a> over time, including remarks at the investment giant's latest shareholder meeting.</li>

          <li><strong>But Ifunanyachi Achara loves it.</strong> A pro soccer player for Toronto FC, Achara said he now takes around half of his salary in bitcoin using the service Bitwage. He <a href="https://t.co/c2SbAZqBHe?amp=1">tells CoinDesk</a> he believes bitcoin is a hedge against fiat inflation â€“ particularly in his home country of Nigeria.</li>


          <li><strong>Blame Instagram.</strong> Bloomberg News <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/cosmetic-surgery-2020-data-butt-implants-up-botox-and-hair-transplants-down">reports</a> that U.S. demand fell in 2020 for most forms of plastic surgery, with one notable exception: butt implants.</li>
