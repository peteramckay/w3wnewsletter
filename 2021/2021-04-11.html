        <p><strong>American leadership in crypto -- or lack thereof -- is suddenly quite a hot topic.</strong></p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L946oGrmeNA">remarks</a> at an event sponsored by the Richard Nixon Foundation, tech investor Peter Thiel mused that bitcoin could be used by China as "a financial weapon" against the U.S. Thiel considers himself pro-bitcoin, mind you, but he specified that the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/peter-thiel-calls-bitcoin-a-chinese-financial-weapon-at-virtual-roundtable">particularly at risk</a> of being displaced by bitcoin over time. This happens to fit the interests of China and other geopolitical rivals.</p>

        <p>In essence, Thiel was issuing a call to action for smarter American policy and planning around the role of cryptocurrencies going forward. He's saying the crypto boom offers both opportunities and risks.</p>

        <p>To put it another perspective, I'd point out that America has now had three presidents since Satoshi Nakamoto published his landmark <a href="http://satoshinakamoto.me/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a> laying out the blueprint for bitcoin. The first was essentially silent on crypto, the second was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20691188/president-donald-trump-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-facebook-libra">openly hostile</a> to it, and the third has so far gone back to silence.</p>

        <p>To be fair, each man had advisers and cabinet secretaries who were thoughtful about crypto to varying degrees. But at the presidential level, there's frankly been no clear vision.</p>

        <p>If crypto is truly the future of the global economy, shouldn't we have that?</p>

        <p>By comparison, Chinese leader Xi Jinping publicly said last fall that his country should <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/president-xi-says-china-should-seize-opportunity-to-adopt-blockchain">"seize the opportunity"</a> in blockchain technology, identifying it as a core category where China should innovate. </p>

        <p>China has since pushed ahead with a pilot of a digital yuan, becoming the first country in the world to issue an official currency on blockchain. The Wall Street Journal's James T. Areddy  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-creates-its-own-digital-currency-a-first-for-major-economy-11617634118">reported</a> on the project Monday, describing its progress as follows:</p>

        <p><em>"A thousand years ago, when money meant coins, China invented paper currency. Now the Chinese government is minting cash digitally, in a re-imagination of money that could shake a pillar of American power."</em></p>

        <p>If there's good news for America here, it's that private industry is increasingly embracing blockchain and honing its lobbying message. On Tuesday, a coalition of U.S. companies including Coinbase, Fidelity, and Square <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210406005392/en/The-Crypto-Council-for-Innovation-Launches-With-Industry-Leading-Member-Organizations">announced</a> they would form new organization, the Crypto Council for Innovation, to push for better public policy around blockchain.</p>

        <p>In his annual <a href="https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm">letter to shareholders</a>, JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon on Thursday also weighed in on the need for updated financial regulations, including around crypto. Dimon wrote:</p>

        <p><em>"There are serious emerging issues that need to be dealt with – and rather quickly: the growth of shadow banking, the legal and regulatory status of cryptocurrencies, the proper and improper use of financial data, the tremendous risk that cybersecurity poses to the system, the proper and ethical use of AI, the effective regulation of payment systems, disclosures in private markets, and effective regulations around market structure and transparency."</em></p>

        <p>Now let's see if and how America's government responds.</p>

        <p>The week's other headlines:</p>
