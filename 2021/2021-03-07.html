        <p><strong>I'm starting a little experiment in journalistic transparency here.</strong> Beginning with this edition of the newsletter, you can now view a <a href="https://github.com/Indizr/web3weekly/commits/master">revision history</a> of the content, including all the earlier drafts, on GitHub.<p>

        <p>In essence, this allows you to track my workflow as I add interesting links throughout the week, then write and edit the final version of the content to send out.</p>

        <p>This is an expanded use of the <a href="https://github.com/Indizr/web3weekly">repository</a> I've always maintained of the newsletter's HTML on GitHub. It was mostly there as a long-term archive before, but now I'm committing to using it regularly throughout the week as a drafting tool as well, so you can "watch" the content evolve over time if you wish. I'll also include a link to this revision history each week from here out.</p>

        <p>I've been toying with this idea for a long time, to be honest. Back when I was a Wall Street Journal reporter in the aughts, I suggested to the newsroom's first social media coordinator that we should maintain and share publicly revision histories of our stories, Wikipedia style, to increase readers' trust in our work.</p>

        <p>People's trust in the press was already starting to wane in that era -- a problem that has only <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/waning-trust-and-a-perilous-financial-landscape-challenge-the-news-business">mushroomed</a> since. I figured additional transparency into our daily workflow might help to remedy the problem. However, word came back that this approach would make the WSJ higher-ups too antsy at the time.</p>

        <p>With the newsletter these days, I don't have that problem. So why not give it a shot, finally? ☺️</p>

        <p>We'll see how it goes from here. <a href="mailto:peter@indizr.com">Let me know</a> what you think anytime.</p>

        <p>On to the latest headlines:<p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Amazon's managed blockchain service now supports Ethereum.</strong> The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/amazon-managed-blockchain-at-last-supports-ethereum-ending-a-two-year-tease">new integration</a> within the popular Amazon Web Services suite should help enterprises experiment and adopt distributed applications more widely.</li>

          <li><strong>The Internal Revenue Service clarified its crypto rules for individual investors.</strong> Buying crypto with fiat currency does not trigger the tax agency's crypto reporting rules, it said on a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/irs-1040-faq-buying-crypto-with-usd">new FAQ page</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Wall Street really, really ❤️ crypto now.</strong> Goldman Sachs is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-relaunches-crypto-desk">relaunching its crypto trading desk</a> after a three-year hiatus. Citi <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/bitcoin-btc-is-at-a-tipping-point-citi-says.html">said</a> in a research note that bitcoin could one day "become the currency of choice for international trade." Charles Schwab is <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/96950/charles-schwab-exploring-white-label-crypto-trading">weighing</a> whether to get into the crypto brokerage business. Discover, the the third-largest U.S. credit-card company, is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/discover-financial-planning-a-roadmap-for-crypto-blockchain-products">looking for a strategist</a> to help it launch new crypto products. And Fidelity published a <a href="https://institutional.fidelity.com/app/literature/item/9901337.html?pos=T">whitepaper</a> for clients exploring the pros and cons of holding bitcoin in their portfolios.</li>

          <li><strong>Meanwhile, some small investors still hate Wall Street.</strong> A group of moderators from the Reddit group WallStreetBets, which recently organized a user revolt against hedge funds shorting GameStop shares, <a href="https://twitter.com/wsbmod/status/1366388480440471553">launched an effort</a> to reorganize as a distributed organization using blockchain-based governance. The push is aimed at giving WallStreetBets greater independence than it has on a company-owned platform like Reddit.</li>

          <li><strong>An acute chip shortage is affecting all major U.S. auto makers, with no end in sight.</strong> Soaring demand for semiconductors has halted auto production in three U.S. states. President Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/24/biden-supply-chain/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_29">ordered a review</a> of how the government might help alleviate such supply-chain bottlenecks for chips and other economically critical goods. Nevertheless, the current crunch seems <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/">unlikely to abate</a> anytime soon, the Washington Post reports.</li>


          <li><strong>Can't escape Big Tech's data collection? Sabotage it instead.</strong> So says a group of researchers from Northwestern University in a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09995.pdf">research paper</a> -- perhaps a surprising source for such a punk-rock idea. The authors suggest that users systematically provide inaccurate information, sometimes with the help of automated browser extensions and other software tools, to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/05/1020376/resist-big-tech-surveillance-data/">reduce the effectiveness</a> of Big Tech's ad-targeting algorithms.</li>


          <li><strong>Audience metrics show journalists how people behave, but not why.</strong> Slate's Future Tense project <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/03/imagined-audiences-journalism-analytics-intuition.html">looked into</a> the increasing use -- and sometimes misuse -- of readership data by news organizations.</li>

          <li><strong>NASA is using Linux to explore the surface of Mars.</strong> The open operating system runs Ingenuity, a small aerial drone launched from the recently landed terrestrial rover Perseverance. The deployment of Ingenuity is the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/linux-is-now-on-mars-thanks-to-nasas-perseverance-rover">first time NASA has used Linux</a> on the red planet. All its previous unmanned probes on Mars, including Perseverance, have used a proprietary OS from Wind River Systems.</li>

          <li><strong>No, that wasn't really Tom Cruise playing golf on TikTok.</strong> Uncannily realistic "deepfake" videos of the actor posted on the popular netowrk <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/deepfake-videos-of-tom-cruise-watched-by-millions-tr8lkmfdk?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1614620214">highlighted the societal risks</a> associated with this new form of misinformation.</li>

          <li><strong>The band Kings of Leon released their new album as a non-fungible token.</strong> The crypto offering, which the group is using alongside more traditional distribution methods as well, is <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/kings-of-leon-when-you-see-yourself-album-nft-crypto-1135192/">a first</a> for the music industry, according to Rolling Stone.
