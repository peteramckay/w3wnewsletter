        <p><strong>Out with airlines, in with crypto.</strong> Could there be a better thumbnail summary of the pandemic era economy than that?</p>

        <p>Behold the home court of the Miami Heat, currently known as AmericanAirlines Arena. However, pending final approval from the National Basketball Association, the building will soon be re-christened FTX Arena, in honor of a crypto exchange that just agreed to buy its naming rights for <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/03/27/nba-still-needs-to-approve-miami-dades-135m-deal-with-ftx-to-rename-miami-heats-home/">a cool $135 million</a>.</p>

        <p>Of course, since the outbreak of COVID, air travel has <a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results-CORP-FI-01/default.aspx">tanked</a>, with passenger traffic still <a href="https://apnews.com/article/travel-air-travel-coronavirus-pandemic-united-states-1c63502b7bee11a7088ae8ee58f26ce0">down 50%</a> among U.S. airlines compared to pre-crisis levels.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, global crypto trading volume is up over 50% since the start of 2020, recently topping $108 billion a day, according to data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

        <p>Guess which of these industries has more cash lying around to spend on marketing (or anything else it wants) right now?</p>

        <p>The week's other headlines:</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Uniswap unveiled an ambitious plan for its v3.</strong> The upgrade of the popular lending platform should improve capital efficiency for investors by 4,000 times when it launches in May, Uniswap said in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/99100/uniswap-v3-capital-efficiency-details-dex-ethereum">its official announcement</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Tesla is now accepting bitcoin as payment for its cars.</strong> CEO Elon Musk announced the move, which has been expected for some time, on <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105?s=21">Twitter</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Ethereum still dominates distributed applications.</strong> Not a huge surprise, I know, but hat's off to Bitcoinist nevertheless for doing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/leading-tokens-that-use-the-most-popular-standard-erc-20/">some deft number crunching</a> on Etherscan to quantify Ethereum's dominance in greater detail. Bitcoinist reports there are currently over 830 projects based on the ERC-20 token standard, with over 350,000 token contracts. Next time you hear of a would-be "Ethereum killer," see if it can measure up to those metrics.</li>

          <li><strong>Crypto.com launched a new platform for non-fungible tokens.</strong> The site has already signed up several famous creators to issue NFTs, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-com-nft-platform-snoop-dogg-lionel-ritchie">including Snoop Dogg and Lionel Richie</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Wall Street keeps adding new ways for clients to buy crypto exposure.</strong> Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-applies-to-offer-notes-linked-to-an-ark-etf-that-may-have-bitcoin-exposure">filed a proposal</a> with regulators to offer new debt instruments</a> pegged to the performance of ARK Investment Management. Separately, Fidelity is looking to <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/99279/fidelity-bitcoin-etf-filing">offer an exchange-traded bitcoin fund</a> that will trade like a traditional stock.</li>

          <li><strong>Ripple</strong> published a <a href="https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cbdc-whitepaper-2020.pdf">whitepaper</a> about its potential use in creating central bank digital currencies.</li>

          <li><strong>Serena Williams led a $5 million investment round in Lolli.</strong> The bitcoin rewards startup allows users to <a href"https://www.lolli.com/">earn up to 30% back</a> in bitcoin rewards when they shop with merchants such as Sephora, Nike, Staples, and Microsoft. The tennis star <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/serena-williams-invests-in-5-million-funding-round-for-bitcoin-rewards-company-lolli/">invested in Lolli</a> through her firm <a href="https://www.serenaventures.com/">Serena Ventures</a>.</li>

          <li><strong>Looks like remote work is here to stay.</strong> More than one-fifth of  executives expect to cut office space for their companies in the coming year, according to a <a href="https://www.aicpa.org/press/pressreleases/2021/aicpa-survey-finds-more-than-1-in-5-companies-plan-some-reduction-in-office-space.html">new survey</a> by the American Institute of CPAs survey.</li>
