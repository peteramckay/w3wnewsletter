<h1>Our broken relationship with technology</h1>

<img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_WMKfXSI6Vc/VRitVeMNT1I/AAAAAAAAjqE/5rZ4MIzKnh0/s1600/Zoolander_334Pyxurz.jpg" alt="Derek Zoolander and Hansel contemplate their foe's iMac">

<p>Let's talk for a moment about Hansel -- the doofus supermodel sidekick in the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/search/?search=zoolander">Zoolander</a> comedy franchise. He's a fascinating character for many reasons, among them (and crucially for our purposes) his use of technology.</p>

<p>At one point in the plot of the first Zoolander film in 2001, Hansel and a friend – the titular Derek Zoolander – break into the office of an international crime boss to steal information off his computer to bring the villain down. Hansel and Derek at first struggle to log in to the computer, so they decide to make off with the entire machine instead. It's an early iMac, with the iconic egg-shaped body and clear back.</p>

<p>They later confront the crime boss at a party packed with other fashionistas. From an elevated deejay booth, Hansel waves the pilfered iMac above his head and loudly proclaims that the files on the computer will prove the fiend's crimes.</p>

<p>Hansel then hurls the iMac to the dance floor below, where it shatters. Looking down at the debris, he wonders aloud: "Where did all the files go?"</p>

<p>What's remarkable about this gag is that it hinges on the audience's understanding of computer file systems in order to have a knowing laugh at poor Hansel's expense. In 2001, that gag “worked” because the writers could safely assume such knowledge on the typical viewer’s part. But if they were drafting that script today, I'm not sure they could have such confidence.</p>

<p>You see, every version of the Mac’s operating system since 2001 has pushed the file system a little further out of the user’s view, so you don’t have to interact with it as much to get tasks done. And the iOS system that runs the iPhone and iPad – devices introduced by Apple in the post-Zoolander years of 2007 and 2009, respectively – has done this even more dramatically.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the file system concept has been a core element of how computer operating systems work for decades, dating to <a href="https://youtu.be/EKWGGDXe5MA?t=4m30s.">before</a> Apple or most other big present-day tech companies even existed. It still is, even if the evidence is now lurking mostly under the surface.</p>

<p>The ostensible reason Apple has pushed the file system out of sight is to improve their final products’ ease of use. Many would say the company has accomplished that goal in spades. But the less-discussed side effect is that individual users now have less visibility into -- and thus less understanding of -- how their tech tools actually work.</p>

<p>In other words, we aren’t so much laughing at Hansel anymore. We are becoming more like him.</p>

<br>

<h3>The fault of people, not technology itself</h3>

<p>This state of affairs wasn't inevitable. The technology didn't necessarily "want" to become this way on its own, in the sense that Silicon Valley is fond of saying information "wants" to be free. (Which is also baloney.)</p>

<p>No, our relationship with our digital tools has become dysfunctional due to very human failings. We’ve developed deeply flawed ideologies attached to our technology, embraced certain assumptions with too little reflection, and made highly subjective creative decisions, like the one to obscure the file system, that could easily have been handled differently by the humans in charge.</p>

<p>The technology we use everyday is becoming more opaque to us even as we increasingly rely on it for everything from managing our personal calendars to curating political news. These two trends -- increasing opacity and dependency -- are inherently at odds.</p>

<p>Together, they are effectively put people at the disposal of the technology, not the other way about. We are thus increasingly running afoul of a <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1921/lange-lecture.html">famous warning</a> by Norwegian political scientist Christian Lange, who said technology makes for “a useful servant but a dangerous master.”</p>

<p>For a recent case study, let’s take the issue of “fake news.” The long-simmering problem of made-up news stories got keen attention following the U.S. presidential election in November 2016.</p>

<p>Facebook in particular came under heavy criticism in the legitimate press for its alleged failings. As the world’s biggest social network by far, with over <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">1.3 billion</a> daily active users as of mid-2017, critics said Facebook should have been more proactive about flagging or even removing patent nonsense like a series of stories about Hillary Clinton running a child-sex ring out of a Washington pizzeria. (One particularly credulous gun owner even conducted his own one-man raid of the pizzaria based on this misinformation.)</p>

<p>As a company, Facebook was at first defensive regarding the accusation that it didn’t do enough to stop fake news. “To think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea," Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/10/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-didnt-sway-election/93622620/">said</a> at a tech conference shortly after the election. But the company later softened its stance, in part because the Obama administration belatedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-tried-to-give-zuckerberg-a-wake-up-call-over-fake-news-on-facebook/2017/09/24/15d19b12-ddac-4ad5-ac6e-ef909e1c1284_story.html">warned</a> Zuckerberg that its intelligence officers had noticed nefarious Russian attempts to misuse Facebook during the election.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/15/facebook-flag-fake-news-fact-check">corrective steps</a> Facebook has taken since then have been widely documented and debated. But a broader set of questions that Lange would surely appreciate should nag us: Why are we so dependent on Facebook as a one-stop news disseminator and forum for debate in the first place? Is that healthy for democracy, or have we reached the point of Facebook playing master rather than servant? If so, what are the alternatives?</p>

<p>Of course it’s a problem, and of course there are alternatives. But it is also worth specifying that this is one big problem that a major tech company like Facebook, no matter how vast its resources, will never address.</p>

<br>

<h3>The Frightful Five</h3>

<p>You see, here we have bumped into another very human, strictly non-technical issue: oligopoly. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, we’ve seen it -- and occasionally its even nastier cousin, monopoly -- do great harm to consumers and innovation itself in a slew of other industries, from oil to telecommunications to banking. The tech industry is and has been no different, even though we often seem bent on pretending otherwise.</p>

<p>Certainly, the increasing economic concentration of the tech industry in recent years is indisputable. New York Times tech columnist Farhad Manjoo laid out the problem quite succinctly in an early-2016 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/technology/techs-frightful-5-will-dominate-digital-life-for-foreseeable-future.html">piece</a> about what he dubbed tech’s “Frightful Five” companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Though Manjoo inexplicably stopped just shy of applying the “o-word” to this cohort, he lamented the dangers of having such a handful of companies, all based in a single country, dominate users’ online lives as the Frightful Five currently do in a growing number of ways.</p>

<p>Manjoo also wasn’t too optimistic about breaking that influence, it should be noted. But he did at least hold it out as a possibility. A pertinent excerpt of his column, with some added emphasis of my own:</p>

<blockquote><p>In various small and large ways, the Frightful Five are pushing into the news and entertainment industries; they’re making waves in health care and finance; they’re building cars, drones, robots and immersive virtual-reality worlds. Why do all this? Because their platforms — the users, the data and all the money they generate — make these far-flung realms seem within their grasp.</p>

<p>Which isn’t to say these companies can’t die. Not long ago people thought IBM, Cisco Systems, Intel and Oracle were unbeatable in tech; they’re all still large companies, but they’re far less influential than they once were.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the good news: The current Frightful Five oligarchy need not be permanent either. If we can deliberately break it down, we still have a chance to fix our broken relationship with our tech and, by extension, improve the function of our politics and society in general as well.</p>

<p>The task will not be easy, however. Entrepreneurs must create alternative services that at times take the Frightful Five head on, not flinch from competition. Government needs to do a better job of protecting competition and free expression, without veering into heavy-handedness. And users must make more conscious choices about how we effectively vote with our feet every time we buy a tech product or give away our personal information in exchange for a “free” online service.</p>

<br>

<h3>Finding alternatives to the oligarchy</h3>

<p>To some degree, this is already happening. Data breaches at Apple, Yahoo, and a slew of non-tech companies in recent years have made everyday users more cognizant of how their personal data is used by third parties. Apple’s iDevice sales have recently leveled off, in part because users are increasingly seeing through, and flat-out rejecting, the company’s marketing push for them to upgrade every year. And Facebook and Google now routinely face skepticism and questioning from users and the press about privacy protections with each new product release -- scrutiny that previously was in short supply.</p>

<p>In some cases, upstarts are even making headway in the marketplace against deeply entrenched Frightful Five products by explicitly emphasizing privacy or openness as key features for users. A few examples:</p>

<ul>

 <p></p><li>The search engine DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from competitor Google by not tracking users’ personal data for the sake of targeting ads. It has more than <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html">tripled</a> its search traffic over the last three years to over 14 million queries a day.</li>

 <p></p><li>Off-the-shelf encryption technologies have seen increased adoption in the U.S. recently among users looking to guard their privacy against the post-9/11 surveillance state, especially now that it’s being handed off to the would-be authoritarian Trump. Encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp are displacing the defaults on iPhones and Androids for some users. Similarly, the encrypted Tor browser now offers an alternative to Chrome or Safari.</li>

<p></p><li>A small but growing cohort of developers, manufacturers, and users are increasingly adopting the open Linux operating system for everyday use on personal devices as an alternative to Windows, macOS, and other proprietary systems. A major contributor to the trend is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)#Adoption_and_reception">Ubuntu</a>, a Linux-based system published by London-based Canonical that has drawn more than 40 million users. In recent years, manufacturers including Dell and System76 have begun shipping PCs with Ubuntu preinstalled, just like the longtime OS market leader Windows.</li>

<p></p><li>The Linux-based gaming platform Steam is challenging Microsoft’s Xbox and other proprietary systems. It now claims more than 125 million active accounts and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/stats/">regularly supports</a> more than 14 million concurrent players over the course of a typical day.</li>

<p></p><li>The open Real Simple Syndication standard, declared dead by many commentators in 2013 when Google killed its RSS app Reader, is still very much <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/rss-dead-look-numbers/">alive and well</a> as a way to get digital news without relying on a social network. Within two years of Google Reader’s demise, its smaller RSS competitor Feedly jumped from 5,000 paid subscribers 50,000.11 There has also been a boom in subscriptions to podcasts, which are digital audio broadcasts based on RSS. And Dave Winer, the developer generally regarded as the creator of RSS, remains a strong advocate of it and other open technologies, which he often <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/24/keyConceptOfTheOpenWebWorkingTogether.html#aWADSA">describes</a> as “creating” rather than “consuming” users’ freedom.</li>

<p></p><li>The <a href="https://piwik.org/history/">Piwik Project</a>, based in New Zealand, makes an open-source web analytics platform as an alternative to Google Analytics. More than a million sites in 150 countries now use it, including the sites of Forbes, T-Mobile, and Wikimedia.</li>

</ul>

<p>To be sure, the market share for most of these products is still modest as a percentage of their Frightful Five rivals. But their usage is moving in the right direction in every case. And, perhaps as important, their very presence in the marketplace proves that it is indeed possible to accomplish important tasks on a computer without over-relying on the Frightful Five. No one can credibly dispute that at this point.</p>

<br>

<h3>Community values, not corporate ones</h3>

<p>In early 2015, the veteran tech writer and journalism professor Dan Gilmor <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/02/why-im-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft/#.twqt15wot">blogged</a> a powerful personal testimonial about switching to open technologies in lieu of corporate-controlled proprietary ones for his own everyday computing. He explicitly couched this in political terms:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve changed my mind about the politics of technology. I now believe it’s essential to embed my instincts and values, to a greater and greater extent, in the technology I use.</p>

<p>Those values start with a basic notion: We are losing control over the tools that once promised equal opportunity in speech and innovation—and this has to stop.</p>

<p>Control is moving back to the center, where powerful companies and governments are creating choke points. They are using those choke points to destroy our privacy, limit our freedom of expression, and lock down culture and commerce. Too often, we give them our permission—trading liberty for convenience—but a lot of this is being done without our knowledge, much less permission.</p>

<p>The tools I use now are, to the extent possible, based on community values, not corporate ones.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gilmor is by any stretch an exceptionally savvy user of technology. He is no one’s Hansel. Many less-experienced users lack his savvy, but they increasingly do at least have the impulse to seek tools beyond those offered by the Frightful Five.</p>

<p>As that gap closes, we might eventually have a relationship with our technology that Lange would approve of. There is yet hope.</p>
