<h1>Headlines & Links</h1>
<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>

<ul>

<p></p><li>A pair of new books covering the implications of tech oligarchy just dropped. Looking forward to picking up both: New York University business professor <strong>Scott Galloway's</strong> <a href="http://www.thefourbook.com/">"The Four"</a> and Atlantic tech correspondent <strong>Franklin Foer's</strong> <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/interrogation/2017/10/why_it_s_time_to_panic_about_the_power_of_big_technology.html">World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech</a>.</li>

   <p></p><li><strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> have opened up recently about abuses of their platforms by Russian agents looking to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They're also taking some <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/10/2/16395342/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-advertising-policies-russia-investigation-election-moderators?utm_campaign=recode.social&utm_content=recode&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter">steps</a> to prevent similar abuses in the future. But <strong>Recode</strong> notes that they still haven't stopped the Putin propaganda site Russia Today from <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/10/3/16405096/twitter-facebook-russia-today-rt-congress-investigation-presidential-election">advertising</a> on their networks as of this week.</li>

   <p></p><li>The <strong>Online News Association</strong>'s annual confernce is underway in Washington. If you couldn't make it (like me, unfortunately) the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ONA17?src=hash">#ONA17</a> is a great way to follow along with the proceedings remotedly.</li>

   <p></p><li>For good reason, Buzzfeed's <strong>Charlie Warzel</strong> <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/the-big-tech-platforms-are-still-botching-breaking-news?utm_term=.bqdmkQDzyp#.ovbzYa5yeZ">teed off</a> this week on the big tech platforms for continuing to botch breaking news. In the early hours following the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, the algorithms that Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the like rely on to sort true information from false failed miserably, as they have during multiple previous breaking news stories.</li>

   <p></p><li><strong>Android Central</strong> just posted an <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nougat-2-percent-september-oreo-makes-appearance?utm_source=ac_tw&utm_medium=tw_card&utm_content=63147&utm_campaign=social">updated breakdown</a> of usage of various versions of Android. About half of users are some version of either on Nougat (Android 7.x) or Marshmellow (Android 6.x), with a small amount of Oreo (Android 8.x) beginning to creep into the data for the first time since its release in late August.</li>

   <p></p><li><strong>The International Journalists' Network</strong> reports that a group of female journalists and data experts calling themselves the <strong>Naija Data Ladies</strong> are <a href="https://ijnet.org/en/blog/naija-data-ladies-rise-network-women-data-journalists-nigeria?utm_content=buffer65521&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">working to change</a> the digital media landscape in Nigeria, Africaâ€™s most populous country. Bravo!</li>

<h1>A quick social media sync</h1>

<img src="http://www.badchix.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/seen-on-badchix-mark-zuckerberg-back-in-his-harvard-years-17-photos-16.jpg" alt="Mark Zuckerberg in the early days of Facebook">

<p>I'm doing a cleanup of various online accounts I maintain personally and for Indizr. Nitty-gritty on what's in, what's out for me follows.</p>

<p>The biggest change to my existing "social stack" is that I'm phasing out two accounts entirely -- LinkedIn as of October 31, 2017, and my Facebook account as of June 30, 2018.</p>

<p>You'll notice, I'm taking some time with these, especially Facebook, so as not to lose touch entirely with existing friends there. I'm heeding <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/08/24/lets-turn-the-tables-on-tech-sunsetting/">my own previous advice</a> about "sunsetting" old or unwanted accounts, to give everyone adequate time to transition to other methods of finding me online. But I am definitely now committed to getting the heck off LinkedIn and Facebook altogether by their respective deadlines, for reasons I'll describe further on.</p>

<p>Other ways to contact me instead:</p>

<ul>


<p></p><li><strong>Email:</strong> Best personal address for me these days is <a href="mailto:peter@indizr.com">peter@indizr.com</a>.</li>


<p></p><li><strong>Social:</strong> Best option here is Twitter. My personal handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay">@peteramckay</a>. Indizr's is <a href="https://twitter.com/itsindizr">@itsindizr</a>. If you're a hacker, there's also an <a href="https://github.com/indizr">Indizr page</a> on GitHub, or you can follow <a href="https://github.com/peteramckay">my personal account</a> there.</li>

<p></p><li><strong>RSS:</strong> If you want to subscribe to Indizr the old-school way, link to the feed is <a href="https://indizr.com/feed/">here</a></li>

</ul>

<p>So why the reshuffling? Well, I see several benefits to this new approach to online presence, including better privacy, more control, and deeper engagement with tools I actually enjoy using more.</p>

<p>If you're a user of any of the above platforms that I said I'll be supporting, please do give me (or Indizr) a follow. Would be great to connect there as well!</p>

<p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr this week. If you have ideas for links or stories we should cover, please do pass them along via either <a href="https://twitter.com/itsindizr">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:peter@indizr.com?subject=Idea%20Submission">email</a>. <em>-- Peter A. McKay</em></p>
