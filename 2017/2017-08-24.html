<h1>Let's turn the tables on tech sunsetting</h1>

  <p>We've all seen it happen. There's a tech product you love and use every day, then the company that makes it decides to discontinue it, apparently on a whim.</p>

<p>  From the tech industry's standoint, this practice is called <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3209144/software/sunsetting-the-right-way.html">sunsetting</a>. The idea is that by phasing out certain products, they can save money or better allocate engineering talent to more promising projects, or both.</p>

<p>  In many cases, the company will announce a "sunset" date for a product that's some time off in the future, to help users prepare and make a gradual transition. Hence the comparison to the sun gradually going down.</p>

<p>  As users, I think we should put this concept to work as well.</p>

<p>We all have social, email, and cloud accounts we'd love to stop using, but never do out of sheer inertia. A personal version of sunsetting would work perfectly for this scenario. Set a deadline some time off, use the account a little less over time, and then shut it down altogether when the sunset date comes.</p>

<p>I've already stopped using Gmail this way myself in lieu of self-hosted email. It took about six months, with the key tactic being never to send messages from the account. I'd check it, but as new messages would come in, I'd reply from my new addresses. Over time, my contacts have now gotten used to the new accounts.</p>

<p>Next up for me are LinkedIn and the biggie of them all -- Facebook. I think that one will take a year to sunset, so I don't lose touch with anyone. But once I'm off, it will free me up quite a bit for Twitter, this blog, and life in general.</p>
