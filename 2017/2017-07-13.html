<h1>Almost ready...</h1>
  <p>Hello. This is my first email to friends who recently joined the mailing list for my new site, <a href="https://indizr.com">Indizr</a>. Thanks again for your interest in this little personal project.</p>
  <p>I'll be blogging at Indizr about digital independence — an issue that's become increasingly important to me through my work on startups and in journalism. It's important to me to approach this in an accessible way, though, for geeks and technology newbies alike. Those groups tend to talk past each other way too much as it is, to great detriment for everyone.</p>
<p>Indizr is still pre-launch. If you visit the site right now, you won't see much. But it should go live in the next week or two. Right now I'm just doing final tests of a few of the tools I'll be using to publish (including this email list :-).</p>
<p>My tentative plan is that the Indizr website will have regular blog posts, which will be redistributed in this once-a-week email, along with some one-off links and extras that didn't make the cut for the web. So you've really got a front-row seat by subscribing to this list.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to get into the spirit of the proceedings, here's <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/cb5b2262972b0cb6543967aa9/images/1c852511-96e8-4edd-844d-853172dad255.jpg">a desktop wallpaper image</a> for your computer with the nifty new Indizr logo. (Just right-click on the image to download it once the page loads in your browser.) I'm using this as my own wallpaper right now, as a visible reminder to stay on task, finish the site, and not get too distracted by cat videos.</p>

<h2>Headlines & Links</h2>
<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/world/americas/mexico-missing-students-pegasus-spyware.html">reports</a> that technology the Mexican government ostensibly bought to combat criminals and terrorists was <strong>instead turned on independent investigators</strong> looking into the disappearance of political protestors.</li>
  <li>The age of tech behemoths like Google and Facebook is presenting <strong>unique challenges to antitrust regulators</strong> around the world, many of whom are laboring under rules written during the Industrial Revolution. Bloomberg offers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/antitrust-built-for-rockefeller-baffled-by-bezos-quicktake-q-a">a good explainer</a> of the situation.</li>
  <li>Digital privacy advocates often point out that users <strong>tell intimate things about themselves to search engines</strong> that they would never confide to a stranger in person, or perhaps even a close friend or relative. Data scientist Seth Stephens‑Davidowitz <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/09/everybody-lies-how-google-reveals-darkest-secrets-seth-stephens-davidowitz">has studied</a> this dynamic for hints about people's hidden biases, fears, et cetera. (The Guardian)</li>
  <li>A wicked satire by <strong>Keith A. Spencer</strong> in Salon: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/07/09/what-if-all-journalists-wrote-like-tech-journalists/">What if all journalists wrote like tech journalists?</a></li>
  <li>Cool to see that actor <strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong> will be one of <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america/program/featured-speakers?utm_source=tlf-newsletter&utm_campaign=ons17&utm_medium=email">the keynote speakers</a> at the Linux Foundation's Open Source Summit this September in Los Angeles. I knew Levitt played Edward Snowden in the movies (as well as the occasional computer sleuth Robin), but didn't know until reading his speaker bio that he's now a digital-publishing entrepreneur himself.</li>
  <li><strong>Social sync:</strong> In addition to the Indizr website, there's also already an Indizr <a href="https://twitter.com/itsindizr">Twitter feed</a> and <a href="https://github.com/indizr">GitHub page</a>. Please follow Indizr there as well, if you use those platforms.</li>
</ul>
