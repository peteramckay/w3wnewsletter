<h1>Free and open tools we're using to publish</h1>
  <img src="https://indizr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/logos.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484">
  <p>As part Indizr's <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/07/20/hello-world/">recent website launch</a>, I used a bunch of free and open-source software to set up our publishing infrastructure. I want to shout out some of those tools here, as they may also be useful to readers who are working on new websites or other creative projects of your own.</p>
  <p>In many cases, these tools will replace ones that are either more expensive or don't work as well, or both. Now, let's get to the list:</p>

  <ul>
    <p></p><li><strong>WordPress.</strong> The obvious choice for our content-management system, since it runs <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/wordpress-now-powers-25-of-the-web/">about a quarter of all sites</a> on the web. If you want to self-host WordPress as your CMS, you can get started by downloading a free copy of the software <a href="https://wordpress.org/">here</a>. Or, if you want a more quick-and-dirty hosting solution, there are a bunch of providers who can get you up and running in minutes, including <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>.
    <p>If for some reason, WordPress just isn't your cup of tea, there are several other good open-source CMS options out there. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> is used by many large organizations because developers love its modular architecture. There's also <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a>, a more recent upstart that's designed from the ground up both to integrate well with social networks and give you control of your own website.</p></li>
    <p></p><li><strong>FontSquirrel.</strong> A recurring theme you'll notice in this post (and probably subsequent ones) is that I try to avoid products from massive, oligarch-sized tech companies if possible, the better to support competition and dynamism in the market. <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/">FontSquirrel</a>, a great source of freely licensed web fonts, was a helpful find in that regard, as it kept me from defaulting to Google Fonts for typography.
    <p>(This site uses the font <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/find_fonts?q%5Bterm%5D=Hattori+hanzo&q%5Bsearch_check%5D=Y">Hattori Hanzo</a> for headlines and <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/find_fonts?q%5Bterm%5D=PT+Serif&q%5Bsearch_check%5D=Y">PT Serif</a> for pretty much everything else, by the way. Thanks, FontSquirrel!)</p></li>
    <li><strong>GIMP.</strong> A great open-source <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">alternative</a> for image editing versus Adobe's proprietary PhotoShop. I know the latter has its rabid fans, especially among professional graphic artists, but I've found over the last few years that GIMP fits my relatively more modest needs just fine. I created <a href="https://indizr.com/static/img/logo-black-1000.png">the Indizr logo</a> with it.</li>
    <li><strong>Wikimedia Commons.</strong> A <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">repository</a> of freely licensed images and artwork from the same folks who publish Wikipedia. The nifty little beaker image we use in the Indizr logo and for our site icon came from Wikimedia Commons.</li>
    <li><strong>LetsEncrypt.</strong> A nonprofit that issues <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">free security certificates</a> to allow publishers big and small to encrypt their site traffic. Obviously, a very important and useful tool now that everyone is increasingly concerned about their privacy online.</li>
    <li><strong>Piwik.</strong> In my opinion, this open platform for <a href="https://piwik.org/">audience analytics</a> is almost criminally underrated as an alternative to Google Analytics. There's really no reason to put the latter's code on your site anymore, as if they need more data about who's visiting which websites. (News flash: They <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/why-googles-spying-on-use_b_3530296.html">really</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/15/google-needs-to-do-a-lot-more-than-fire-employees-who-abuse-user-data/">really</a> don't.)</li>
    <li><strong>Ubuntu.</strong> A popular version of the Linux operating system, which I use to run this site's server. I've also been using it as the daily workhorse on my <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop">desktop</a> PC for about five years now, for reasons similar to the ones eloquently laid out by veteran tech journalist and Ubuntu user Dan Gilmor in <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/why-i-m-saying-goodbye-to-apple-google-and-microsoft-78af12071bd">this Medium post</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Nginx.</strong> A great piece of open, fast <a href="https://nginx.org/">webserver software</a> for handling and resolving visitor requests for posts and other content. I'm also a fan of the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> server platform, which I've used on other web projects. But Nginx was my go-to here as it seemed to play nicer, right out of the box, with the scripting language <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> required to run WordPress.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Well, that's it for now. I'm sure I'll be back with more open-source picks in future posts as well as they come to my attention.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, good luck with whatever you're building today! If you need some inspiration, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaIUh-QC7aY">this video</a> of Quentin Terrantino's take on Hattori Hanzo.</p>




<h2>Headlines & Links</h2>
<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>
<ul>
  <p></p><li>Vice's <strong>David Gilbert</strong> reports that Russia and China <a href="https://news.vice.com/story/russia-and-china-keep-blocking-more-and-more-of-the-internet">keep blocking</a> more and more of the internet. I guess Russia is ever "a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma," as Churchill famously put it decades ago. But in China's case, I wonder about the particular modern narrative that political engagement with the West and market-based economic development are supposed to naturally nudge China toward more civil liberties as well. That's been the narrative we've heard in the West since Nixon re-opened U.S.-China relations in the 1970s, but it doesn't seem to be working as far as I can tell.</li>
  <p></p><li>Ex-CIA director <strong>James Woolsey</strong> and legendary hacker <strong>Brian J. Fox</strong>, who invented the Bash command line, write in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/open-source-software-hacker-voting.html">New York Times op-ed</a> that U.S. elections would be more secure if we used open-source technology in our voting machines. As it is, we tend to use proprietary software that vendors sell to the states purely for profit, with limited independent testing.</li>
  <p></p><li>The <strong>Columbia Journalism Review</strong> helpfully <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/ad-tech-journalists-media-today.php">reminds</a> journalists they should care more about ad technology. You know, the thing that still pays most of the bills, no matter how many wishful thinkpieces we get about the promise of the paywall business model.</li>
  <p></p><li>Now we know: Syria's dictatorship <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/08/03/netizen_report_tech_community_mourns_open_source_activist_executed_by_syrian.html">executed</a> open-source activist <strong>Bassel Khartabil</strong> in 2015. His whereabouts had been unknown since then, but his wife now says she's received confirmation of his fate, sadly.</li>
