<h1>This Week's Headlines & Links</h1>
<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>
<ul>
 <p></p><li><strong>The Trump administration</strong> is doubling down or tripling down or whatever the proper multiplier is now -- we lose track -- regarding its anti-immigrant approach to governance by increasing surveillance of foreigners. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/us/politics/immigrants-social-media-trump.html">reports</a>: "The Department of Homeland Security will soon begin collecting social media data from all immigrants entering the United States, part of what agency officials call an effort to more effectively screen those coming to the country but privacy advocates see as an unnecessary intrusion that would do little to protect national security."</li>
 <p></p><li>ESPN host <strong>Jemele Hill</strong> has written a <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/jemele-hill-on-doing-the-right-thing/">commentary</a> for the sports site The Undefeated reflecting on the recent controversy over her anti-Trump tweeting.</li>
 <p></p><li><strong>ICYMI:</strong> The Washington Post's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-tried-to-give-zuckerberg-a-wake-up-call-over-fake-news-on-facebook/2017/09/24/15d19b12-ddac-4ad5-ac6e-ef909e1c1284_story.html?utm_term=.975ca7485614">story</a> last weekend about the Obama administration alerting Facebook to abuses of its platform by Russian agents attempting to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a blockbuster. In hacker terms, this really shows the extent to which the supposedly brilliant minds in Palo Alto got utterly <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwn">pwned</a> by the Russians.</li>
 <p></p><li>Speaking of the <strong>WaPo</strong>, it recently started using <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/the-washington-post-starts-using-talk-an-open-source-tool-for-improving-online-comments/s2/a709821/">Talk</a>, a new open-source commenting system designed to create more constructive user engagement with news content. Talk is an outgrowth of the <strong>Coral Project</strong>, an open initiative sponsored by the Post, <strong>New York Times</strong>, <strong>Mozilla</strong>, and other digital-publishing biggies. It's nice to see them cooperating on this sort of stuff.</li>
<p></p><li><strong>Ryan Holmes</strong>, CEO of the social platform Hootsuite, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/would-you-buy-65-retro-phone-instead-iphone-x-ryan-holmes/?hootPostID=5206fd7d9be6b0631072597e7318616c">says</a> retro tech might be starting a prolonged combeback. Never mind the iPhone X; it's all about $65 feature phones that don't spy on you as much.</li>
