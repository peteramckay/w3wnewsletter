<h1>Sage advice from WaPo's Fowler on the iPhone X</h1>

<img src="https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/m5LLFsvNhyq9dBZ7zMPOEriuI14=/fit-in/970x0/2017/10/31/e73ffb33-1690-4ebc-91d8-7317faf392b0/iphone-x-52.jpg" alt="iPhone X in the wild">

<p>The headline on my old Wall Street Journal colleague Geoffrey Fowler's review of the iPhone X says it all:</p>
<p><em>"The iPhone X-factor: Don’t buy a phone you don’t need"</em></p>
<p>I'd of course highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/03/the-iphone-x-factor-dont-buy-a-phone-you-dont-need/">the whole review</a>, which is as perceptive as ever a piece of work from Fowler, now writing for the Washington Post.</p>
<p>I'd also add that his premise is a pretty good rule of thumb when buying <em>any</em> new piece of technology. Always stop to ask: Do I really need this particular thing? What exactly are my needs? And is this particular thing going to do something to meet them that other things can't?</p>
<p>Marketing hype around tech products, as with all forms of advertising, makes it easy to overlook these questions. Apple's hype machine around its iDevices is notoriously potent, but in fairness, their competitors all do it as well.</p>
<p>For instance, the general premise around the marketing of smartphones these days, regardless of maker, is that they're going to be your primary computer. For me, that just isn't true. I still rely primarily on my laptop to accomplish tasks through the day. My smartphone is a valuable complement, of course, but let's not get carried away.</p>
<p>Along similar lines, the general concept that hardware choice is the most important option facing you as a consumer is also dubious, in my opinion. As attractive as literal shiny objects are, the crucial aspect of a lot of our technology these days is the software and services, with the gadget itself increasingly just a disposable commodity to deliver them.</p>
<p>Think about it: How often do you replace your smartphone? Now, if you have a Gmail account or some similar web-based email hosted by a third party, how long have you had that account? And how much do you use it everyday? And how exactly does it affect your privacy?</p>
<p>Now, which layer of your personal technology "stack" should you be putting more thought into?</p>

<h1>Use DigitalOcean to avoid Amazon's cloud</h1>

<img src="http://hackpla.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cloudcomputing.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<p>I'm going to geek out a bit with this installment of <a href="https://indizr.com/tag/the-replacements/">The Replacements</a>, our ongoing series about specific products you can use in lieu of ones from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/technology/techs-frightful-5-will-dominate-digital-life-for-foreseeable-future.html">Frightful Five</a> tech companies. Our first Replacements <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/10/26/this-search-engine-with-a-funny-name-respects-your-privacy/">post</a> was about internet search -- something we all do everday as we <em>consume</em> information. But what about when you want to publish or store something online?</p>

<p>To do that, you're going to need a server of some kind. (There's nothing special about servers, by the way. That fancy-sounding term just refers to any computer that's dedicated to the purpose of storing information to share over a network. Any computer can be a server.) In the simplest possible example, when you post a message on a social network, your words are stored on a server run by that network.</p>

<p>For more complex creative projects, however, you might want to run your own server, which can either be a computer you have physical access to or one you connect to remotely. The latter type of machines are said to be "in the cloud," in IT parlance, and they're used to run many of the websites and apps you use everyday. They're a crucial piece of backbone for the entire internet these days.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning, Amazon dominates the market for cloud servers. Yes, <em>that</em> Amazon. The bookstore guys. As a "side" business, their Amazon Web Services unit generated $4.6 billion in revenue last quarter. That's more than 30 percent of the internet infrastructure market, by far the largest share in the industry, according to a recent report by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/30/aws-continues-to-rule-the-cloud-infrastructure-market/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent">TechCrunch</a>.</p>

<p>Also worth noting: Microsoft, a fellow member of the Frightful Five, holds the number-two position in the market. So this crucial underpinning for the entire internet is very much ruled by the big boys.</p>

<p>That said, there are other choices. Among them is our latest Replacements pick: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>.</p>

<p>Indizr's website is hosted on DigitalOcean servers, so without even realizing it, you're using one of their machines right now by reading this post. I've also used DigitalOcean on several other projects the last few years, including sites for several friends and startup organizations. I've also used AWS on a couple of past projects, though nothing at present.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean's pricing structure, which is definitely simpler than AWS, has been cheaper for me. But in fairness, AWS may win on that front for some projects depending on what size server you need, how much traffic the machine is going to handle, and other variables that AWS takes into account.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean calls each cloud server a "droplet," and you can get one for as little as $5 a month. That basic droplet comes with one dedicated CPU, 20 gigabytes of storage, and 1,000 gigabytes of data transfer included. But you can upgrade from there, at proportionally higher prices.</p>

<p>Droplets are available running any of several versions of Linux or FreeBSD. (Sorry, Windows and MacOS users. But, hey, those are also Frightful Five products that we're trying to avoid here. They are available on AWS, for the record.) You can also add in WordPress, Discourse, or a number of other open-source apps or tools to a droplet as part of the setup process.</p>

<p>Speaking in particular as a self-taught hacker and entrepreneur, I have to say I've found DigitalOcean much easier to use than AWS in a number of respects. The flat pricing is more intuitive, in my opinion, and their web-based dashboard for managing droplets is also more user-friendly. They also have a great community-driven store of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community">articles</a> with how-to and software support information that's saved me on many an occasion.</p>

<p>Even if I weren't specifically writing a blog series called The Replacements, I doubt I'd be going back to AWS anytime soon.</p>

<h3>Headlines & Links</h3>
<p>Recent independence-related info from other sites around the web:</p>
<ul>
 <p></p><li>The encrypted text-messaging app <strong>Signal</strong>, which many folks have adopted on their smartphones for greater privacy, now has a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/standalone-signal-desktop/">desktop app</a> as well for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Nice!</li>

<p></p><li>If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, the tech blog <strong>Ars Technica</strong> will host a free talk titled "A Brief History of Crypto" at 7 p.m. next Wednesday, Nov. 15 at Eli's Mile High Club, a dive bar at 3629 MLK Jr. Way in Oakland. You can RSVP via <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/a-brief-history-of-crypto-tickets-39461862493">Eventbrite</a>.</li>


 <p></p><li>A worrisome piece of free-speech news: <strong>The Anti-Defamation League</strong> says the number of assaults, acts of vandalism and violence against Jewish institutions nationwide rose 67 percent in the first three quarters of this year to 1,299 incidents compared to the comparable period least year. In fact, the 2017 total so far already surpasses the number of incidents the ADL was able to document for the <em>full</em> year in 2016 as well.</li>

 <p></p><li>The above is worth remembering the next time someone is fretting about the speech rights of white supremacists and neo-Nazis getting kicked off a campus or whatnot. Who, exactly, do you think it is that's increasingly violating Jewish people's constitutionally guaranteed rights to assemble and worship as they please? Your outrage is much better placed on <em>that</em>, believe me.</li>

<p></p><li><strong>The International Center for Journalists</strong> recently released <a href="http://www.icfj.org/news/first-ever-global-survey-news-tech-reveals-perilous-digital-skills-gap">a study</a> of the state of technology in global newsrooms. The nonprofit surveyed more than 2,700 respondents from 130 countries. Among the findings: "In an era of fake news, digital security threats and competition for audience attention, journalists and newsrooms lack the technology skills to meet the challenges they face."</li>

 <p></p><li>On a brighter note for the media industry, <strong>Politico</strong> and <strong>Jalopnik</strong> have joined the growing ranks of news sites using HTTPS to encrypt readers' visits to their web sites. (A hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/letsencrypt">@letsencrypt</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/letsencrypt/status/927945493795295233">alerting</a> their followers to this one on Twitter.)</li> 

<p></p><li>Speaking of the Twitters: <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo">@DuckDuckGo</a> posted a helpful <a href="https://twitter.com/duckduckgo/status/926792923038957568">reminder</a> that it's a good idea to periodically check in the settings of your smartphone which apps have access to the camera.</li>

<p></p><li><strong>TechCrunch</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/07/hayley-barna-just-became-the-first-female-gp-in-first-rounds-history/">reports</a> that <strong>Hayley Barna</strong> just became the first female general partner in the history of the venture capital firm First Round. A good piece of diversity news for an industry that sorely needs it.</li>
