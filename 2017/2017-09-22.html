<h1>It's been a long time...</h1>
<p>You might have noticed (or not) that Indiz=r has gone dark for awhile now. A little more than two weeks, to be specific.</p>
<p>I apologize for that. Chief reason for the delay is that <a href="https://pmckay.com/sedley">my father passed away</a> Sept. 5, and I've been dealing with the funeral and other related family issues since then.</p>
<p>Now I'm gladly getting back to a more regular routine of posting (and emailing) about all the core areas of digital independence -- privacy, free speech, and the freedom to hack. I think that dear old Dad, who quite enjoyed using an iPod Touch in his later years to listen to music and look up winning Lotto numbers, would want me to do that (C;</p>

<h1>Lessons of the Jemele Hill controversy</h1>
<img src="https://cdn-s3.si.com/styles/marquee_large_2x/s3/images/jemele-hill-could-espn-fire-trump-tweets-1300.jpg?itok=hJIxG_ak" alt="Jemele Hill participating in a panel discussion">

<p>As a journalist by training, my feelings are increasingly mixed about situations like the controversy that erupted last week over ESPN host Jemele Hill's anti-Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/907391978194849793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp">tweetstorm</a>. The pull of the traditional ethos to keep your political opinions off-air is strong, yes. On the other hand, perhaps the imperative to adjust to the social-media era should be more of a two-way street.</p>

<p>Rather than saying individual journalists should adjust by shoehorning the old approach into social, maybe news organizations ought to do some adjusting as well by letting their staffers express more natural human emotion and reaction online, and let the chips fall where they may.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting here, there was a very specific goal that justified the old approach -- the need to maintain credibility with the audience. And the old approach, however well intended, is clearly <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2017/05/10/americans-attitudes-about-the-news-media-deeply-divided-along-partisan-lines/pj_2017-05-10_media-attitudes_a-05/">failing in spectacular fashion</a> at that goal these days even when it's followed to the letter. So what exactly is being achieved by maintaining it at all costs?</p>

<p>If we're in a different world, we have to do things differently. Perhaps there's even <em>more</em> credibility to be had in stating your biases up front, then just getting on with the work from there in good faith, rigorous as ever regarding things like gathering detail, organizing information, prioritizing it, and so on.</p> 

<p>Maybe the audience can intellectually handle that if we just put a bit of faith in them for once rather than treating them like sheep. Maybe they'll actually respect it more.</p>

<p>New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen hinted at such a scenario on Twitter recently:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If user trust were rooted more in "here's where I'm coming from" than "we have no opinions" almost everything in journalism would be easier.</p>— Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/908834776995581952">September 15, 2017</a></blockquote>


<p>There was also this gem:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is it ESPN's job to say, "we do sports, not politics" but not the viewers job to say, "they're sports: who cares about their politics?"</p>— Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/909114576863719424">September 16, 2017</a></blockquote>


<p>It's unsurprising that the brouhaha over Jemele Hill's remarks would catch Rosen's attention, by the way. He's been a big advocate of scrapping the traditional approach to objectivity for about 15 years. In a raft of published articles over that stretch, he's derided journalism's traditional "view from nowhere," and done a pretty detailed job along the way of explaining its origins and deconstructing it.</p> 

<p>If you really want to delve deep into this topic, it's definitely worth perusing his <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22Jay+Rosen%22+%22view+from+nowhere%22&t=canonical&atb=v60-2&ia=web">body of work</a> on it.</p>

<h1>A few GitHub goodies</h1>

<p><img src="https://indizr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/github_octocat.png" alt="Octocat" style="width: 400px; max-width: 33%; float: right; margin: 1rem;">I've previously mentioned <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/08/02/free-and-open-tools-were-using-to-publish/">some handy open-source tools</a> I use to publish this site, all longstanding projects that smart folks have gradually built over time into awesome finished products. </p>


<p>As it happens, I've also coded a few tools of my own. They're not nearly as polished as the ones I mentioned earlier -- I consider them all to be in beta, in fact -- but I want to share them here anyway. If you can use them in something you're working on, great. If you have feedback or want to contribute code to flesh them out, even better (C;</p>

<p>Everything is shared via the Indizr page on <a href="https://github.com/indizr">GitHub</a>, which I love for open-source collaboration. There you'll find the following, all under MIT license:</p>

<ul>
  <p></p><li><strong>Izzie.</strong> A simple HTTPS server script for Nginx. It's configured for PHP sites, since our content-management system is the PHP-based WordPress.</li>  
  <p></p><li><strong>Desmond.</strong> A responsive CSS theme for static webpages. I created this back when Indizr.com was just a landing page. Figured it might come in handy for other one-off pages we might need to put up in the future.</li> 
  <p></p><li><strong>SimpleChimp.</strong> A responsive theme for HTML email, optimized for distribution via MailChimp. I use that app to put out our weekly newsletter, so this was something I ginned up for that purpose.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Again, I'm eager for feedback or code contributions on all this stuff. Feel free to contribute or file bug reports on <a href="https://github.com/indizr">GitHub</a>. Or if you prefer, hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I'll also be updating the GitHub page -- and the blog accordingly -- with new projects over time. So please stay tuned.</p>

<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>
<ul>
 <p></p><li>Programmer <strong>Ben Regenspan</strong> says that Facebook's JavaScript code for third-party websites, which helps to render features such as the "like" button and embedded Facebook comments, makes up a hefty <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-16-of-the-code-on-the-average-site-belongs-to-facebook-and-what-that-means-68956cd731be">16 percent</a> of a typical site's <em>total</em> codebase. Oink.</li>
 
 <p></p><li><strong>ICYMI:</strong> A doozie of a brouhaha erupted in late August about Google's alleged efforts to suppress academics and journalists from writing about touchy topics like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/eric-schmidt-google-new-america.html">antitrust protections</a> and the company's <a href="https://gizmodo.com/yes-google-uses-its-power-to-quash-ideas-it-doesn-t-li-1798646437">strongarm tactics</a> to break into social.</li>

 <p></p><li><strong>Equality Labs</strong> has put together a handy <a href="https://medium.com/@EqualityLabs/anti-doxing-guide-for-activists-facing-attacks-from-the-alt-right-ec6c290f543c">anti-doxing guide</a> for activists facing attacks from the alt-right.</li>
 

 <p></p><li>Speaking of fascists, I stumbled across an extraordinary historical artifact on Wikipedia the other day. An actual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chamberlain_returns_from_Munich_with_Anglo-German_Agreement.ogg">BBC recording</a> of British Prime Minister <strong>Neville Chamberlain</strong> giddily addressing a crowd in 1938 upon returning from negotiating the Munich Agreement with <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>. At the time, Chamberlain was supremely confident it would help prevent war in Europe. In retrospect, you see how that worked out. At a little over nine minutes long, this one is definitely worth a listen, considering the current political predicament in the U.S. and other Western democracies.</li>
