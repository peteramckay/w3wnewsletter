<h1>Unlike Google, this other search engine with a funny name respects your privacy</h1>

<p>This post is the first in an occasional series I've dubbed <a href="https://indizr.com/tag/the-replacements/">"The Replacements."</a> In it, we'll cover products you can use in lieu of specific ones from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/technology/techs-frightful-5-will-dominate-digital-life-for-foreseeable-future.html">Frightful Five</a> tech companies: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>A few disclaimers are in order up front here. First, I have nothing against the Frightful Five personally. I don't think their employees are bad people or anything like that. But it's simply a reality that users are increasingly nervous about this handful of companies' dominance over all aspects of the economy, about the risk that's inherent in that dominance <em>purely as a matter of circumstance</em>.</p>
<p>Several writers have done a good job of <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/gist/2017/10/author_franklin_foer_on_his_book_world_without_mind.html">documenting</a> this problem lately. I want to go a step further by helping users understand what they can actually <em>do</em> about it in their everyday lives.</p> 
<p>That goal also happens to be squarely consistent with Indizr's primary mission to promote digital independence, <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/07/20/hello-world/">defined</a> across the three related areas of privacy, free speech, and freedom to hack the stuff you use everyday. Unfortunately, as the Frightful Five have built up dominant market positions the last few decades, they've also been some of the worst tramplers of these principles.</p> 
<p>In fairness, we could also lump in among the guilty parties here various governments around the world, online fraudsters, certain non-tech companies, and other bad actors. But the point still stands: As a general rule, you will tend to improve your digital independence by ditching the Frightful Five as a user whenever possible.</p>
<p>That brings me to my second important disclaimer: I have no financial relationship with any of the non-Frightful Five companies whose products I'll be recommending as substitutes. The blogoshere being what it is, I realize this bears pointing out.</p>
<p>Finally, apologies to the great punk-rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Replacements_(band)">The Replacements</a>, which shares a name with our little web series. I'd like to think the boys would be supportive of what we're doing here, though, as it's a bit punk in its own way.  </p>
<p>Anyway, on to the good stuff...</p>
<p>My first pick is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, a search engine that does not collect personal information on its users or track them around the web. This has become my primary search engine on both desktop and mobile, and I'm happy to say it is a more than adequate replacement for Google search.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo can be set as the default search engine in the navbar of Firefox, Chrome, and other major browsers. It also has native apps for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-search-stories/id663592361?mt=8">iDevices</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&hl=en">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Like Google, DuckDuckGo is monetized mostly through advertising. But that advertising isn't targeted at you personally the way Google's is -- which is arguably the real point of all their data collection in the first place.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious privacy benefits to individuals from DuckDuckGo's search model, it's also worth pointing out there's a certain social benefit to having everyone see the same search results. Maybe if more folks switch over, it will help solve tech's notorious "filter bubble" problem in which people are nudged by algorithms only toward information and communities that confirm their preexisting beliefs.</p>
<p>Upworthy founder <a href="https://twitter.com/elipariser">Eli Pariser</a> neatly described the "filter bubble" issue in this <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/23568423">TED talk</a>, including test examples of DuckDuckGo search results versus Google. Mind you, Pariser's talk was delivered in 2011, which was an eternity ago in Silicon Valley terms. But given events since then, I'd say the premise that people online aren't united around shared sets of facts still holds up pretty well today.</p>

<h1>Update on My Great Facebook Escape</h1>
<img src="http://soshable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Facebook-on-Screen.jpg" width="1000" height="669" class="alignnone size-medium">

<p>I briefly mentioned a little while back that I want to phase out my Facebook account. To pull off this <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/10/22/16510702/how-to-quit-facebook-addiction-backup-data-delete-account">difficult task</a>, I'm using the concept of <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/08/24/lets-turn-the-tables-on-tech-sunsetting/">"sunsetting"</a> as a consumer that Silicon Valley companies often apply to old products of their own.</p>

<p>I've now announced this decision to my friends on the platform, told them other online channels to follow me, and I've set a deadline for myself to have my account deleted: June 30, 2018. This is purposely a long way off, so I have time to repeatedly nag folks to migrate to my other channels, export my data, and take other steps to make sure I don't lose track of anyone important altogether.</p>

<p>I've also taken the following incremental steps toward winding down my Facebook presence. Listing them here in case any of you are considering a similar move away from the House that Zuck Built:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I've removed the Facebook app from my phone.</strong> I can still acess it through the browser, but the temptation is a lot less if it doesn't have an icon on my homescreen. (This is also somewhat better from a privacy standpoint, as the browser gives Facebook less hardware access to my phone.) Ditto for Facebook-owned platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, which I wasn't much of a user of anyway.</li>
  <li><strong>I've blocked Facebook in my desktop browsers.</strong> Again, this reduces the general time suck of Facebook in my life. I can still access it through my phone browser, or I can turn off the block temporarily if I <em>reeaalally</em> want to look on desktop. But at least that's a more purposeful approach, not leaving me open to mindless surfing over to Facebook. (A hat tip is in order here to the <a href="http://www.timewellspent.io/">Time Well Spent</a> movement, a great resource for educating consumers about addictive tech. Their work has helped inspire me personally to make some changes, including the Facebook move.)</li>
  <li><strong>I've followed certain friends on Twitter and other platforms in lieu of Facebook.</strong> Staying in touch with people post-Facebook is a two-way street. I've told friends on the platform how to find me, but in some cases, it's worth me looking <em>them</em> up elsewhere, which is fine. (Of course, some of the people on my Facebook "friends" list are more tangential connections as well. I'm willing to take a wait-and-see approach with those.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So what's the overarching reason for my big switch? Well, I see several benefits to this new approach to my personal online presence, including better privacy, more control, and deeper engagement with other tools (especially <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay">Twitter</a>) that I actually enjoy using.</p>
<p>Sorry, but on the merits, Facebook flat-out sucks as a product, in my opinion. It has the proverbial "fear of missing out" working in its favor, yes, but little else. That's not enough for me anymore.</p>

<p>Recent independence-related info from other sites around the web:</p>
<ul>

 <p></p><li><strong>Chelsea Manning</strong> was interviewed onstage at the recent New Yorker Festival. The conversation was surprisngly wide-ranging, covering not only Manning's infamous transfer of U.S. government data to WikiLeaks but also some passionate recommendations from her about the data-science profession in genereal. Engineers should get much more training in the human impact of the systems the build, Manning says. Full audio is available <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/8419298/chelsea-manning-on-life-after-prison">here</a>.</li>
 
 
 <p></p><li><strong>Canonical</strong> released <strong>Ubuntu 17.10</strong> on <a href="https://fridge.ubuntu.com/2017/10/19/ubuntu-17-10-artful-aardvark-released/">Oct. 19</a>. This is the first version of Ubuntu, a consumer-oriented distribution of the Linux operating system, that doesn't include the custom Unity interface previously promoted by Canonical as an Ubuntu differentiator. Instead it includes a lightly customized version of the more widely used GNOME interface. Notably, the early implementation of GNOME in Ubuntu got <a href="http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/119306/linux-action-news-24/">rave reviews</a> from hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisLAS">Chris Fisher</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeRessington">Joe Ressington</a> over at Linux Action News, one of my go-to podcasts for all things Linux-related.</li>

<p></p><li>On a similar newspaper-y front, we hear <strong>Lucy van Pelt</strong> is really, truly going to let good ol' <strong>Charlie Brown</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OclrAiKJUeI">kick the football</a> this time.</li>
