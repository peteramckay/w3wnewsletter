 <h1>Why tech companies booting the Daily Stormer actually improves free speech</h1>
  <img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/inglouriousbasterds/images/0/00/Aldo_Raine_about_to_scar_Landa.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130611125909" class="alignnone size-thumbnail">
  <p>GoDaddy, Google, and other tech companies have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-godaddy-idUSKCN1AU0CV">booting</a> the Daily Stormer, a major hate site, from their servers since the weekend's attacks on anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Va. The tech companies claim the Daily Stormer violated terms of use by inciting violence, mocking the Charlottesville victims, and committing sundry other #fails at basic human decency.</p>

  <p>The providers' actions effectively denied the Daily Stormer publishing infrastructure, albeit for what will likely prove just a temporary stretch in the end. The site appears to be down as I write late Tuesday, but there have been reports in <a href="https://qz.com/1053689/cloudflare-is-the-one-tech-company-still-sticking-by-neo-nazi-websites-like-daily-stormer/">Quartz</a> and elsewhere that other tech companies are likely to accept the Daily Stormer's business soon. </p>

  <p>Perhaps predictably, there's also been <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/08/the_one_big_problem_with_godaddy_dropping_the_daily_stormer.html">some hand wringing</a> over whether the service providers who are taking a hard line with the Daily Stormer are undermining free speech. No one should worry about that for a second, though, for several reasons.</p>

  <p>First, the problem of censorship is foremost an issue of <em>government</em> interference, as described in the U.S. Constitution's <a href="http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment1.html">First Amendment</a>. There is no prohibition under U.S. law -- or that of pretty much any other modern democracy I'm aware of -- barring private companies like GoDaddy or Google from denying service to customers whose messages they find odious.</p>
  <p>If anything, isn't this really just an exercise of the service providers' own free speech?</p>
  <p>Which brings us to the other big, very web-specific problem at play here: Hate speech is essentially a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">trolling</a> on steroids. And we all really need tech companies to get more aggressive, not less, about policing troll behavior.</p>
  <p>In the end, trolling is often about denying other people the chance to speak. This is accomplished either by rendering an online forum less useful, or by intimidating certain categories of people (say, women or minorities) into not speaking at all, or some combination of the two.</p>
  <p>By kicking out trolls, then, you make a better, <em>freer</em> forum for everyone else. Mind you, that goal is not mutually exclusive to having disagreements, even heated ones. But the point is that the people running websites and popular services need to take responsibility and draw a line for their communities. Every site or service's standards might be a little different, but that's OK, as long as the standards are clear.</p>
  <p>If you're curious for a deeper dive on this topic, I highly recommend Anil Dash's excellent 2011 <a href="http://anildash.com/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html  ">blog post</a>, hilariously titled: "If your website's full of assholes, it's your fault." </p>
  <p>Perhaps we're seeing a glimmer of Silicon Valley finally coming around to Anil's view of the world. They certainly weren't there before, but maybe the Charlottesville tragedy will serve as a wake-up call that produces lasting change. I sure hope so.</p>
