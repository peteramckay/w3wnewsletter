<h1>Hello, world.</h1>

<em>The <a href="https://indizr.com">Indizr website</a> went live today. Huzzah! Here's the full text of our first post:</em>

<p>Your gadgets and apps should work for <em>you</em>, not the other way about.</p>

<p>In that spirit, I want this to be a different sort of tech blog. One focused not on actual shiny objects, or which companies are "crushing it," but on users first. Then the rest.</p>

<p>I particularly want to help users increase your digital independence — a precious commodity I believe is poorly understood and managed these days. As a result, it's in deep crisis.</p>

<p>I define digital independence holistically, comprising three interrelated issues:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Privacy</li>
 	<li>Free speech</li>
 	<li>Freedom to hack</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean that last term in its positive sense — as in, to make something useful with whatever is at hand. If you can customize or take apart or see the source code of some piece of technology, that's also what I'm talking about here. We need to reclaim this positive meaning of "hacking" from the perhaps more popular notion of shady characters illicitly obtaining and misusing people's data.</p>

<p>(For the record, I'm adamantly against such intrusion, as it is a grave privacy violation. See what I mean about this stuff interrelating?)</p>

<p>I'll confess, the subject matter here is inherently a little geeky. I love geeks. I am a geek myself. But if only geeks read this blog, I'll consider it a failure.</p>

<p>I want this blog to be for everyone, the way the internet itself is supposed to be. I'm a card-carrying member of Generation X, old enough to at least remember the days when the internet broke into mass usage. (Its very invention is before my time, but I've <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">read up</a>.)</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way in the last twenty-plus years, I think we lost sight of the internet's early promise, the democracy of it. It's instead largely become a platform for a few geeks to exploit the many, which was never supposed to be.</p>

<p>This drift has been abetted by the tech press, I'm sorry to say as someone who certainly his share about the press. Most tech coverage focuses on what's <em>going</em> to happen, on making "smart" predictions, usually about what a few giant companies are going to dictate to the rest of us. This baseline assumption of those companies' power in turn has a nasty way of becoming self-fulfilling.</p>

<p>Overlooked is a better, more important question. Its premise could also be self-fulfilling, if it only received such consistent attention:</p>

<p>What do we all <em>want</em> the internet to be?</p>

<p>Let's figure that out, then work to make it happen. Ultimately, that's what this blog is about.</p>

<h2>Headlines & Links</h2>
<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Anders Gyllenhaal,</strong> a senior editor at McClatchy, asks a provocative question in <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/article158805569.html?utm_content=buffer1aca8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">a recent column</a>: Do we still believe in free speech?</li>
  <li>A few days ago, I stumbled across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN9FWjxSOKU">presentation</a> that <strong>New York University business professor Scott Galloway</strong> did in Spring 2016. Speaking at his alma mater, the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business, he talked about the increasing winner-take-all dynamic of the tech industry and its full, frightening implications. Even though this content is a little old, it holds up well a year-plus later. Definitely worth a watch.</li>
  <li>In doing the setup of the new Indizr site, I came across <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/7-security-measures-to-protect-your-servers?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=7_measures_server_security_tut&utm_content=no_image">this post</a> from 2015 by our web host, <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>, with seven tips to secure your servers. Again, the information here has stood the test of time. DO's recommendations to use SSH keys, along with similar steps, are bedrock technical advice that always warrants reinforcement for folks making their own stuff on the web.</li>
  <li>Finally, a link that's sorta loosely related to Indizr's scope: <strong>Former British diplomat Carne Ross</strong> recently gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hc2_jY4KhY">a TED talk</a> about how he became an "accidental anarchist." I won't spoil the whole thing, but the core of his argument revolves around how best to manage change. Hmmm...</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now. Thanks for spending some time with Indizr this week. If you have ideas for links or stories we should cover, please do pass them along either via <a href="https://twitter.com/itsindizr">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:peter@indizr.com?subject=Idea%20Submission">email</a>.</p>
