<h1>Linux is my ecosystem</h1>
<p><img src="https://indizr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tux-248x300.png" alt="" width="248" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-574" id="tux">We are conditioned as users to think our choice of computer operating systems is binary -- Mac or Windows. It's an ancient tech rivalry, spawned by two of the most renowned entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley history, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. And, of course, there were those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPvW4eQ5kAY&list=PL2B73A382291A18C5">twee commercials</a> in the 2000s with actor John Hodgman famously embodying the clueless Windows PC.</p>

<p>There is, however, another option that gets less attention: Linux. An open-source operating system, Linux has long been popular for webservers (including the one for <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/08/02/free-and-open-tools-were-using-to-publish/">this site</a>) and other enterprise-type functions. But now there are an increasing number of consumer-focused versions of Linux out there, of increasing quality that makes switching over easier than ever.</p>

<p>I can vouch, as someone who switched over the version of Linux called Ubuntu about five years ago, that it works just fine as my day-to-day laptop OS. I email, surf the web, write documents, and do a bunch of other tasks just fine (or better) than when I was using Windows and Mac.</p>

<p>My reasons for switching were very similar to those of veteran tech columnist and journalism professor Dan Gillmor, who has written very eloquently about his own switchover on several occasions. If this is something you think you might want to do, I'd highly recommend you check out Dan's <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/01/i-moved-to-linux-and-its-even-better-than-i-expected/">2016 piece</a> in Wired in particular, as it contains a bunch of useful nitty-gritty.</p>

<p>As an open piece of software, Ubuntu gives me full control to tinker and customize my computer however I like. Crucially, to borrow a phrase from Dan, it also frees me from the increasing "control freakery" of Apple and Microsoft.</p>

<p>The only thing I'd add is that, for me, using Ubuntu for my desktop computing has also had the unexpected knock-on effect of drawing me deeper into using Android for mobile. Android is based on Linux, so it "plays" very nicely with my Ubuntu computer. My phone mounts as a readable drive on my computer via USB, and I can add or remove whatever files I want directly to it that way.</p>

<p>In this way, I've created a personal computing "ecosystem" that works very well for me across all my devices, including greater compatibility with any new tools I might add to the system as I go. You can't really do that with the proprietary tech companies' stuff, as they tend to purposely make their stuff not work with that of competitors.</p>

<p>Purists would point out that the version of Android you get on consumer phones like mine (a Moto G5) isn't really open software. The developer's version of Android is, but not what the one you get at your local mobile carrier store, including additional proprietary customizations. Using Android does thus put me somewhat in the clutches of another tech giant -- Google. But I find that problem a little easier to mitigate, mostly through purposely avoiding Google's software and services, setting defaults for non-Google apps, and so on.</p>

<p>For instance, my default browser is mobile Firefox, not Chrome. My default search engine on Firefox is DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track my personal details in the same way that Google search does. And so on.</p>

<p>This approach to mobile is an imperfect workaround, I'll admit. But it just underscores the lack of truly open options in that world. At some point, if one emerges in the future, as Ubuntu has for desktop, I would definitely switch. My current setup is flexible enough that that wouldn't be hard at all when the time comes.</p>

<h1>The Defenders only halfway fixes Iron Fist</h1>

<a href="http://media.comicbook.com/2017/02/iron-fist-colleen-wing-actors-talk-about-comic-influence-234724-1280x0.jpg"><img src="http://media.comicbook.com/2017/02/iron-fist-colleen-wing-actors-talk-about-comic-influence-234724-1280x0.jpg" width="1280" height="704" alt="Colleen Wing and Danny Rand" class="size-medium"></a>

<p><em>Marvel/Netflix heroes Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) and Danny Rand (Finn Jones), looking for a solution.</em></p>

<br>

<p>Let's face it, our <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/07/20/hello-world/">subject matter</a> around here tends to be a little geeky, in the sense of technology stuff. I'm thus going to take license to go a little off-topic for a moment, assuming a significant portion of you are also superhero fans like me. These are closely related substrata of geekery, after all.</p>
<p>After binging on the first season of the Marvel team-up show The Defenders on Netflix, I've reached some non-spoilery realizations about Iron Fist. The character, not his namesake standalone show, which I also binged on awhile back.</p>
<p>Like most fans, I thoroughly enjoyed The Defenders, and didn't so much enjoy Iron Fist's solo show. I didn't hate the latter as much as the professional critics did almost <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/marvel_s_iron_fist">universally</a>. I think it got better as it went along, especially beyond the first five episodes most of the critics based their reviews on prior to the public release of the series. Still, it's clearly the weakest entry in the Marvel's Netflix universe.</p>
<p>As a number of the pros have also pointed out, The Defenders does a lot to rehabilitate Iron Fist (the character). In an ensemble along with Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones, he's better complemented, and most of the plot of the series revolves around the origins of his powers in the mystical Himalayan city of K'un-Lun.</p>
<p>That said, let's not get carried away. Iron Fist is still the weakest link in The Defenders. By a lot. And I think there's an obvious fix hiding in plain sight for future seasons.</p>
<p>For starters, Marvel should do the time-honored thing TV producers have always done with characters that aren't quite working: Kill Iron Fist off.</p>
<p>To be more specific, they should kill off <em>Danny Rand</em>. He's the current possessor of the Iron Fist power, which (as we're frequently reminded in the Marvel Netflix shows) is eternal, passed down over generations through multiple individual Iron Fists.</p>
<p>See, the Iron Fist as a concept is fine in these Netflix shows. It's <em>Danny Rand</em> who's the real problem, whether it's the character itself or actor Finn Jones who portrays him. (I lean toward the former, but no matter.)</p>
<p>And there's an obvious successor here to be the <em>next</em> Iron Fist: Rand's sidekick Collen Wing. Some baddie could mortally injure Rand, and in his dying moments, he passes the power of the Iron Fist to Colleen Wing.</p>
<p>Boom. In one stroke, this would solve several problems:</p>
<ul>
  <p></p><li>It removes The Defenders' weakest link.</li>
  <p></p><li>It gives the team (and the show) some drama to perhaps drive the whole second season. They have to hunt down Rand's killer!</li>
  <p></p><li>It builds on existing strengths of the franchise. Colleen Wing and the actor who plays her, Jessica Henwick, have gotten great reviews, even qualifying as highlights of the much maligned first season of The Iron Fist solo show. Which brings us to...</li>
  <p></p><li>It gives us a reason to watch the second season of Iron Fist.</li>
  <p></p><li>It adds to the franchise's diversity in a way that's perfectly organic. As many critics have pointed out, the character of Iron Fist, a martial arts master, should probably be Asian anyway. Bonus points for creating a strong female character as well if you give the title to Wing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only, very slight downside to giving Wing the power of the Iron Fist is that it would flagrantly violate the canon of Marvel's comic books. Marvel generally hasn't done much of that in its cinematic universe, but they should lighten up. If a change makes sense onscreen, just go with it. Heck, they could even stand to write it into Wing's storyline in the comics too, similar to what rival DC Comics did when they moved the popular cartoon character Harley Quinn onto the printed page as well.</p>
<p>For the canon sticklers, I'd also point out, there is precedent in the comics for killing off Danny Rand. Marvel <a href="http://www.supermegamonkey.net/chronocomic/entries/power_man_iron_fist_125.shtml">did it</a> for a stretch in the 1980s when his books weren't selling well (before eventually bringing him back). It shouldn't be that hard to do on Netflix as well. </p>
