<h1>WordPress maker publishes federal requests for user information</h1>
<p>For non-geeks, the company Automattic isn't exactly among tech's household names. Their stock isn't publicly listed, and they don't do slick TV commercials, like <a href="https://vimeo.com/84548363">Apple</a> or even <a href="https://vimeo.com/151021819">Google</a> on occasion. But you've almost certainly heard of Automattic's flagship product -- WordPress. It runs about <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/wordpress-now-powers-25-of-the-web/">a quarter of all websites</a>, including this one.</p>
<p>That's why what Automattic did this week is a big deal for anyone who values privacy. They published redacted versions of five "national security letters" they received from the government between 2010 and 2013, requesting information on specific users.</p>
<p>As Automattic's  Paul Sieminski points out in <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2017/07/25/shining-light-on-national-security-letters/">the company's official post</a> announcing the release, their goal here is to raise public awareness about the nature of NSLs, which carry serious restrictions upon the recipient companies and, by extension, their users.  Sieminski writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>NSLs are legally controversial because no judge reviews the information demands before they are issued, and they often come with a nondisclosure requirement (also known as a “gag order”) that lasts for an indefinite amount of time and can end up being permanent. An NSL gag order legally prohibits the recipient (often an internet company like Automattic) from sharing a copy of the NSL with the user whose account info is being requested. It also prevents the company from sharing any information about the NSL publicly, or from even making a public statement that they received the NSL at all. Instead, the government allows NSL recipients to report the number of NSLs they receive in a broad range, which is designed to give the public an idea of the number of NSLs received during a certain period of time. This is why we reported receipt of 0-249 NSLs for certain periods covered by our Transparency Report.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the USA Freedom Act, passed in 2015 in the wake of the Edward Snowden controversy, there is now a process for tech companies to requst "reciprocal review" from the FBI of old NSLs, to see if the gag restrictions are still necessary. If the companies get clearance, as Automattic did with this week's batch of letters, then they can publish them.</p>
<p>As Sieminski notes, Yahoo and Google took similar steps in 2016 and released some letters as well, to their credit.</p>
<p>These releases deserve our close attention as users as well. Again, please do check out <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2017/07/25/shining-light-on-national-security-letters/">Automattic's full post</a>, as well as the actual letters. They're just now beginning to give us a clearer picture of how our data is being accessed, which agencies are doing so, and why.</p>

<h1>One more reason to delete your Myspace account (besides the fact it's 2017)</h1>

<p>The podcast <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now/episodes/620">Security Now</a> recently detailed a glaring privacy problem with Myspace, made all the more worrisome precisely <em>because</em> no one actually uses Myspace anymore.</p>
<p>Short takeaway: Just take ten minutes and delete your Myspace account if you're not using it. For that matter, this is a good reminder to delete <em>any</em> "zombie" online account you don't actively use, since they usually retain some information about you that <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/157460/hacker-hat-colors-explained-black-hats-white-hats-and-gray-hats/">black-hat hackers</a> might piece together to better impersonate you elsewhere and thus steal data from accounts you actually <em>do</em> use.</p>
<p>In other words, you may never log in to a certain service, but remember that data you previously gave that service will probably still be sitting out there on the internet -- and possibly subject to abuse -- unless you actively delete the account.</p>
<p>According to Security Now, Myspace's particular problems of late stem from their attempt to come up with a way for users to recover their (presumably long-ago) forgotten Myspace passwords without using an email address, as most services will prompt users to do during recovery. The form-based method Myspace cooked up to do this is easily crackable by third parties.</p>
<p>For a fuller lowdown, I'll leave you to the <a href="https://youtu.be/BcTRUDVClO0?t=30m40s">excellent explanatory coverage</a> by Security Now hosts Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte. If they follow up in a future episode, I'll also update you in this space.</p>
