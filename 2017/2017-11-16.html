<h1>Hold on a minute...</h1>
<p>For good reason, there's been much <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=at%26t+time+warner+merger&t=hj&atb=v90-4_b&ia=news&iar=news">ink spilled</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion/att-time-warner-merger.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fopinion&action=click&contentCollection=opinion&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=sectionfront">hands wrung</a> in the press regarding the Justice Department's call last week for Time Warner and AT&T to sell assets if they want complete their proposed mega-merger. The government says its ostensible "antitrust" concerns would require a sale of either DirectTV or CNN, which are both currently owned  by Time Warner. The president happens to <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881503147168071680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftrump-tweet-video-body-slamming-punching-cnn-fnn-wwe-2017-7">hate</a> the latter property in particular because it consistently airs unflattering (and true) things about him.</p>

<p>I find myself having surprisingly mixed feelings about this story, to be honest. Like many other people, I don't want the White House using policy to grind a political ax against CNN. That's an obvious First Amendment violation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I can't exactly say I'm eager to see AT&T as the owner of CNN either. Putting aside questions of business hegemony just a moment, for the sake of argument, there's zero indication that AT&T would be a good <em>steward</em> of CNN's journalistic mission.</p>

<p>That's an important word to include in any discussion of a deal like this. Journalism isn't like any other business, in that it requires a mix of profit motive, competent business execution, and public-mindedness among the owners. The track record of these sorts of media mergers in the past isn't very promising in that regard, with the public-mindedness part usually being the first thing that suffers.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, I did a quick web search to check if I've missed some past comment by AT&T about journalism, or its aims in that area. Here's <a href="https://indizr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ddg.png">the result</a> I got:</p>

<h1>The pipe dream of a true Linux phone lives on</h1>
<img src="http://openw3.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Ubuntu_For_Phones.png" width="858" height="470" class="alignnone size-full">
<br>
<p>Like a lot of other people -- OK, a very <em>few</em> other people -- I was disappointed when the tech company Canonical announced in April that it would <a ref="http://www.techradar.com/news/canonicals-dream-for-an-ubuntu-phone-is-dead">end support</a> for the mobile version of its open Ubuntu operating system.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have an alternative mobile OS to the duopoly of Android and iOS -- one of the tightest strangleholds in all of tech. There are a bunch of market-share numbers floating around the web, using different methodologies, but the consensus is that Android and iOS have combined share north of 90 percent on U.S. smartphones. Globally, their combined share runs north of 80 percent.</p>
<p>In other words, this is ripe territory for some purer form of the open Linux OS to step in. In fairness, Android is Linux-based, but with some very Google-y customizations. That's especially true of the form of Android you're likely to find on the shelves of your local mobile carrier's store.</p> 
<p>For instance, the phones sold there pretty much <em>have</em> to include apps for Google-owned services like Drive, YouTube, and Gmail, which you can't delete as a user. That's a pretty big violation of the spirit of open-source software, even if Android can still reasonably claim to be way more customizable than iOS. (Let's not even get started about that one.)</p>
<p>Since Ubuntu is one of the more popular Linux systems for PCs, a lot of us who use it that way have been hoping for a phone version as well. When Canonical ended official support for Ubuntu Touch, I figured some community of geeks would keep that mobile version alive in some form as a labor of love. But I wasn't sure until over the weekend <em>how</em> robust that effort would be. </p>
<p>Pretty awesome, it turns out. I just belatedly came across the community site <a href="https://ubports.com/">UBports</a>, which is still working on the Ubuntu Touch software. Their organizing, documentation, and continued development over the last few months have been pretty impressive indeed, as you'll see if you poke around the site yourself.</p> 
<p>To boot, they're also developing an abstraction layer called <a href="https://halium.org/">Halium</a> for mobile hardware in general, to make <em>any</em> Linux variant much easier to run on a wider array of devices.</p>
<p>This is all great news. In fact, it's enough to make me confident to jump into Ubuntu Touch for my daily smartphone use in the next week or so for the first time. (I've done some experiments with it on my spare devices the last two years, but never really integrated it into my daily workflow.) Will update you on how it goes.</p>

<h3>Headlines & Links</h3>
<p>Recent independence-related info from other sites around the web:</p>
<ul>
 <p></p><li>The <strong>Mozilla Foundation</strong> just <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">released</a> its Firefox 57 update, which <a href="">Joey Sneddon reviewed</a> very favorably over at <em>OMG! Ubuntu!</em>. I definitely agree with him after poking around the last few days myself on this new version of the browser, which Mozilla has dubbed "Firefox Quantum." The big difference is much snappier performance -- an area where many reviewers over the years have said Firefox lags its rival Chrome. There are a few other handy new features as well, like a library option to save articles to read later. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a new browser.</li>

 <p></p><li><strong>Joel Simon</strong>, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, says in <a href="www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/opinions/free-press-world-looks-to-america-to-defend-media-opinion-simon/index.html">a new post</a> for CNN.com that the world still looks to the U.S. to set an example regarding press freedom. Unfortunately, he's noticed on recent visits to countries like Myanmar and Ukraine that they've been backsliding lately on press freedom.</li>


 <p></p><li><strong>ICYMI:</strong>Alphabet's executive chairman, <strong>Eric Schmidt</strong>, recently <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40488115/alphabets-eric-schmidt-on-fake-news-russia-and-information-warfare">unburdened</a> himself to <strong>Fast Company</strong> about his own oversights leading up to the 2016 election. Regarding powerful information-sharing technologies like Google search, Schmidt said: “One of the things I did not understand was that these systems can be used to manipulate public opinion in ways that are quite inconsistent with what we think of as democracy.” </li>
