<h1>TechCrunch gets it right on free speech</h1>

<p>A hat tip to TechCrunch's John Constine, who's just published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/scaling-civility/">post</a> on how the social networks' specific interpretation of free speech is enabling behavior that ultimately <em>curtails</em> many people's speech.</p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<blockquote><em></em><p>Civil free speech is sacrificed in exchange for hatred, degradation and threats. Who can respectfully speak up for their convictions if they’re immediately shouted down? Women and people of color have been attacked this way for years and have been demanding change for years. It’s time for white men, who largely control these services and the traditional media, to stand by them as allies and actually take action. As a white male reporter, I’ve failed to do enough to force this issue.</p>

<p>The rules must change. The enforcement must become stricter and more consistent. But the operators of these new communication utilities must also uphold the spirit of free speech rather than the letter. That will require challenging, messy, expensive and inefficient solutions. In other words, human solutions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Amen, John. We said <a href="https://indizr.com/2017/08/16/why-tech-companies-booting-the-daily-stormer-actually-protects-free-speech/">essentially the same thing</a> in August when white supremacists were catching heat from their domain registrars and hosts (and undeserved sympathy elsewhere as supposed censorship victims) after the Charlottesville attack. And blogger Anil Dash had <a href="http://anildash.com/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html">come around</a> to this view even well before that.</p>

<p>Let's hope the message keeps spreading through the tech industry. Again, it will be bad for hateful trolls. But it will produce freer and more productive discussion for everyone else, which is the important thing.</p>

<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>
<ul>

  <p></p><li><strong>Bloomberg</strong> notes that a major backlash is brewing against mbig tech companies, including a likely increase in regulation. But investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-19/tech-rally-persists-as-growth-forecasts-outweigh-crackdown-risk">don't care.</a></li>
  
 <p></p><li><strong>The Justice Department</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/justice-department-drops-request-for-names-of-people-wh-1819448329">has dropped</a> its earlier request for the names of an estimated 6,000 people who “liked” a Facebook page about an Inauguration Day protest, the American Civil Liberties Union said. The ACLU recently challenged several warrants related to protests against President Trump’s inauguration, one of which included the search, claiming they were over-broad. (Gizmodo)</li>
 
 <p></p><li><strong>Hypocritical much?</strong> White nationalist <strong>Richard Spencer</strong> had complete control over which journalists could cover his much-publicized "free speech" event this week at the University of Florida, a public school. Chalk it up to a poorly negotiated contract between the university and the private-sector organizers of the event, says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/18/white-nationalist-richard-spencer-florida-free-speech">The Guardian</a>. </li>

 <p></p><li>The <strong>Online News Association</strong> has posted <a href="https://ona17.journalists.org/resources/">a handy page</a> with links to video and other resources from various sessions at its recent annual convention in Washington.</li>
 
 <p></p><li><strong>Let's Encrypt</strong> announced it will <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018.html">start issuing</a> free "wildcard" security certificates in January. This is a long-awaited feature among developers, as it will allow them to secure multiple subdomains of a website using a single cerrt.</li>
