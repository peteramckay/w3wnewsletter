<p>Recent independence-related info from around the web:</p>

<ul>



  <li>The <strong>Economist Intelligence Unit</strong> just <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/25/us-democracy-downgrade/">downgraded</a> the U.S. in its widely followed democracy index. It's now a "flawed democracy," down from a "full democracy" previously, according to the magazine's research arm. Among other factors, the Economist cited a long-term decline in popular trust in U.S. government and elected representatives to "extremely low levels." Separately, longtime New York Times columnist <strong>Tom Friedman</strong> sounded an uncharacteristically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/opinion/trump-russia-putin.html">urgent warning</a> about the specific threat that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> poses to American democracy. And the <strong>Columbia Journalism Review</strong> <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/cjr_threats_issue_toronto.php">says</a> that the U.S. is rapidly losing its status as a beacon of press freedom.</li>  



   
  <li>One year after protracted sit-ins opposing construction of the <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong>, bills have been introduced in 30 U.S. states to <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/photos-since-standing-rock-56-bills-have-been-introduced-in-30-states-to-restrict-protests/">restrict protests</a> in various ways. Although the bills haven't all been enacted, and many likely couldn't withstand constitutional court challenges, they suggest a disturbing political trend, according to the <strong>American Civil Liberties Union</strong>.</li>  




  <li><strong>Twitter</strong> is <a href="https://www.axios.com/twitter-limits-automated-tweets-curb-bots-7f9617ba-d6da-4a7d-9029-7d808a35a29d.html">imposing hard limits</a> on automated user activity, to combat abusive behavior and misinformation. The network's Silicon Valley rivals, including <strong>Facebook</strong>, have so far stopped short of such restrictions. But Twitter may nevertheless be <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/how-twitter-lost-the-internet-war/amp">falling behind</a> in key strategic areas as a company due to indecision and turmoil in the executive suite, according to <strong>Vanity Fair</strong>.</li>

  <li><strong>FYI & FWIW</strong>: A handy, plain-English <a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/an-executive-primer-to-deep-learning">primer</a> on "deep learning" by computers, by data scientist <strong>Pradeep Menon</strong>. (This one was recently recommended on Twitter by <strong>Kirk Borne</strong>, an astrophysics Ph.D. who's chief data scientist at the consulting giant <strong>Booz Allen Hamilton</strong>. So I'm confident it's worth passing on :-)</li> 

  <li>Microsoft founder <strong>Bill Gates</strong> <a href="https://qz.com/1206184/bill-gates-warns-silicon-valley-not-to-be-the-new-microsoft/">is warning</a> that Silicon Valley's largest companies seem headed for anti-trust trouble in Washington, perhaps akin to his company's legal battles in the late 1990s. Speaking of which...</li>

  <li><strong>Charles Duhigg</strong> reports in the <strong>New York Times Sunday Magazine</strong> that some of <strong>Google</strong>'s sharp-elbowed business practices may <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html">cross the line</a> into anticompetitive territory.</li>


  <li>A <a href="https://medium.com/@sexandstartups/zebras-unite-to-fix-what-unicorns-broke-f1095a2dc55c">nascent movement</a> of "zebra" tech startups is forming, with aspirations to be more humane, diverse, and community-focused than the typical Silicon Valley startup model has allowed. Since SV refers to its breakout companies as "unicorns," the "zebra" founders picked a different animal to distinguish themselves.</li>
  

  <li><strong>Wired</strong> reports that <strong>Facebook</strong>'s new virtual private network app, <strong>Onavo Protect</strong>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-onavo-protect-vpn-privacy/">leaves a lot to be desired</a> on privacy. Which is, you know, basically the entire point of using a VPN.</li>

  <li>Intentionally or not, the <strong>House that Zuck Built</strong> also seems to be at a point of <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/facebook-media-buzzfeed.php">threatening "armageddon"</a> for journalism, writes veteran tech journalist <strong>Mathew Ingram</strong> in the <strong>Columbia Journalism Review</strong>.</li> 


<li>Latvian officials say <strong>Russian hackers</strong> also appear to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-20/latvia-signals-russia-may-be-interfering-in-banking-crisis">exacerbating an unfolding banking crisis</a> in their country. “There is a high probability that an externally organized widespread information operation is being carried out that, by its structure and execution, is identical to those observed in pre-election periods in the U.S., France and Germany,” Latvia’s Defense Ministry said in an emailed statement to <strong>Bloomberg News</strong> on Tuesday.</li>

  <li><strong>The Verge</strong> reports that Google's <strong>Chrome</strong> browser will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991254/chrome-not-secure-marked-http-encryption-ssl">mark all unencrypted HTTP sites</a> as "not secure" starting in July.</li>
