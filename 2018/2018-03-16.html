  <p>The latest news from around the web about media innovation:</p>

  <ul>
  
    <li>Like <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> before it, <strong>YouTube</strong> is getting its turn in the sun as a source of misinformation and hate online. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html">New York Times op-ed</a> on Sunday, technologist Zynep Tufekci said her research suggests YouTube's algorithms effectively make it a "radicalizing engine" that points readers to gradually more extreme versions of whatever they first searched for. On Tuesday, in remarks at the SXSW conference, YouTube CEO <strong>Susan Wojcicki</strong> talked up new anti-propaganda tools coming to the service, including a plan to display <strong>Wikipedia</strong> content alongside factually sketchy material to balance things out. The <strong>Wikimedia Foundation</strong>, which maintains Wikipedia for free, said it had no heads-up such an announcement was coming. Its executive director, Katherine Maher, also gently <a href="https://twitter.com/krmaher/status/973791488583888896">pointed out on Twitter</a> that it doesn't get much "in-kind support" from entities monetizing its valuable content. Translation: "Silicon Valley is kinda freeloading, yo."</li>


<li>Monday marked the <strong>29th anniversary</strong> of the launch of the <strong>worldwide web</strong>. Its inventor, <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, <a href="https://webfoundation.org/2018/03/web-birthday-29/">noted</a> on the World Wide Web Foundation's site that his creation now reaches over half the world's population for the first time. But he warned the web is also "under threat" from misinformation, abuses of personal data, and other serious ills.</a></li>


    <li>Six more tech companies have <a href="https://gizmodo.com/six-more-big-internet-companies-just-joined-the-legal-f-1823520627">joined</a> the nonprofit <strong>Coalition for Internet Openness</strong>, which is suing the Federal Communications Commission over its recent move to end internet neutrality in the U.S.</li>
    
    <li>The <strong>Online News Association</strong> has set up a <a href="https://ona18.journalists.org/suggestion-box/">suggestion box</a> for sessions to be included in its annual national conference. Deadline to submit is March 29, and the conference is in Sept. 13-15 in Austin. </li>


<li><strong>The Boston Globe</strong> announced a <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/03/06/the-boston-globe-to-hike-home-delivery-rates.html">big increase</a> in its subscription prices, in what could mark an interesting test case for the limits of subscriber-based revenue models for news. At full cost, not factoring in any introductory offers or other discounting, a seven-day subscription to the Globe will now cost $1,347 per year. Yowza.</li>

    
    <li><strong>Netflix</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> are launching new projects for news video, dipping a toe into TV journalists' traditional territory. <strong>Nieman Labs</strong> points out that these efforts will seek to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/its-mostly-older-people-who-watch-tv-news-can-netflix-and-facebook-change-that/">attract younger viewers</a> to a news format that's so far appealed almost exclusively to much older ones.</li>
    
    <li>The <strong>Knight Commission on Media, Trust and Democracy</strong> recently held a meeting and panel discussion in Miami to discuss <a href="https://medium.com/trust-media-and-democracy/five-takeaways-from-miami-meeting-of-knight-commission-on-truth-media-and-democracy-6bf9198d87ca">obstacles and possible solutions</a> to journalism's recent credibility crisis.</li>

     <li>Cutest victory for free speech we've ever seen: Middle schooler <strong>Max Gregorian</strong> this week sent <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMaxGregorian/status/972992376812732418">his first (and, as of this writing, his only) tweet ever</a>. He defended his mother, New York Times White House correspondent <strong>Maggie Haberman</strong>, who's been subject to personal attacks by a certain U.S. president. The boy even made sure to @ the two adult principles in the situation, so he'd pop up on their notifications (C:</li>

    <li>For anyone who cares about <strong>innovation</strong>, the passing of renowned physicist <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong> is a monumental loss. Our favorite story about him that re-surfaced this week: As a "simple experiment," he once <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/stephen-hawking-time-travelers-party">held a cocktail party</a> for time travellers by sending out the invites <em>after</em> the party. No one showed up for the event, much to his disappointment. "I was hoping a future Miss Universe would walk through the door," Hawking remarked.</li>
    
    <li><strong>ICYMI:</strong> March 6 marked the <a href="https://nerdist.com/big-lebowski-20th-anniversary-why-the-dude-abides-endures/">20th anniversary</a> of the release of the <strong>Big Lebowski</strong>. Truly, the Dude abides.</li>
