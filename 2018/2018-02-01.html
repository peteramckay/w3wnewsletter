  <h1>Ad-supported sites face an unlikely new rival for revenue: Amazon</h1>
  
  <img src='http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/441/bezos.jpg' alt='Swole Jeff Bezos'>
  
  <p>News sites and other digital publishers are already in a death match with Google and Facebook for ad sales. Now another tech giant, Amazon, may be joining the fray, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p> 
  <p>In a story Monday, WSJ tech reporter Chris Mims wrote:</p>
  <p><em>Amazon doesn’t break out advertising as a separate business, but according to a new report by J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth, the company racked up an estimated $2.8 billion in 2017 ad revenue. That’s small compared with his estimate for Google’s ad revenue in 2017: $73 billion. Yet in 2019, he expects Amazon’s revenue to more than double to $6.6 billion.</em></p>
  <p>Mims points out that, as the internet's major retailer by far, Amazon has the richest data on what people actually buy online. By comparison, their competitors mostly try to triangulate guesses about what you might buy through observing user behavior online, demographics, and other data about you.</p>
  <p>That makes for a massive strategic advantage for Amazon.</p>
  <p>To boot, the many merchants who list their goods for sale on Amazon are all jockeying for prime position when users search Amazon for, say, a pair of socks. Amazon sells top placement in those results, much like Google sells ad space atop its search results. Hence its increasing revenue opportunities.</p>
  <p>A possible knock-on effect of this, of course, is that publishers who are already reeling from flagging ad sales may have yet another headache coming down the pike if Amazon's ad sales grow as expected over the next few years. And the journalism that is a key lifeblood of Western democracy may get even harder for those publishers to fund.</p>
  <p>Mims' full Amazon story is available <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-amazons-ad-business-could-threaten-google-and-facebook-1517157327">here</a>, albeit via the WSJ's paywall.</p>

<p>Recent independence-related news from around the web:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The <strong>New America Foundation</strong> this week held a series of panel discussions in partnership with <strong>Slate</strong> about the future of free speech online. Speakers at the event included <strong>Sen. Amy Klobuchar</strong> (D-Minn.), longtime tech journalist and educator <strong>Dan Gillmor</strong>, and New York Times tech reporter <strong>Cecilia Kang</strong>. Full video ofthe event is posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=q9FlATmYVcs">here</a>.</li>


  <li>The <strong>Mozilla Foundation</strong> and the <strong>Ford Foundation</strong> recently launched an Open Web Fellows program to build global leadership around public interest technology and open web advocacy. They're looking for organizations to host the fellows once candidates are selected. If you're interested, check out the <a href="https://medium.com/read-write-participate/host-an-open-internet-activist-7e22374221c9">full details</a> of the program.</li>

  <li><strong>Mozilla</strong> also recently published a handy guide to protecting your personal data when you use <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/safety/public-wifi">public wi-fi networks</a>. Breaches over such networks are a bigger risk than many users realize.</li>

  
  <li>How important is it to set strong passwords and remember them? Poynter's <strong>Ren LaForme</strong> reports that a failure to do so by Hawaii's governor <a href="https://www.poynter.org/news/two-solutions-creating-safe-and-unforgettable-passwords-and-preventing-nuclear-scares">exacerbated his state's recent nuclear scare</a>. </li>
 
  
  <li>The geolocation features on personal fitness trackers have been inadvertently <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/610086/fitness-app-data-is-revealing-military-bases-to-enemy-fighters/">revealing U.S. troop movements overseas</a>, reports the <strong>MIT Technology Review</strong>.</li>




  <li>The upcoming <strong>Ubuntu 18 LTS</strong> release will include a new desktop <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/01/ubuntu-18-04-new-app-to-do">to-do list app</a>. Sounds like a handy new feature for Ubuntu, a consumer-focused version of the open Linux operating system.</li>

  <li><strong>Engadget</strong> reports that <strong>Washington</strong> state is considering legislation to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/26/washington-state-bill-ban-hard-to-repair-electronics/?sr_source=Twitter">make hard-to-repair electronics illegal</a>. The Consumer Technology Association, the Telecommunications Industry Association and the Computer Technology Industry Association are all opposing the bill, which comes on the heels of legislation in 17 other states recognizing a consumer "right to repair."</li>

  <li>The <strong>Freedom of the Press Foundation</strong> is <a href="https://freedom.press/news/archiving-alternative-press-threatened-wealthy-buyers/">launching</a> an online archives collection in partnership with <strong>Archive-It</strong>, a service developed by the <strong>Internet Archive</strong> to help organizations preserve online content. Their collection, focusing on news outlets the foundation deems to be especially vulnerable to a "billionaire problem," aims to preserve sites in their entirety before their archives can be taken down or manipulated. The project is positioned as a preventive to scenarios like the one now faced by the defunct site <strong>Gawker</strong>. Its archive reportedly may be bought soon and defaced by venture capitalist <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>, a sometime subject of unflattering coverage by Gawker.</li>

 
  <li><strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> have far more to worry about than just Russian bots as they try to police disinformation on their platforms leading into November's congressional election in the U.S. There are also a host of domestic crazies and bad actors who shouldn't be overlooked as risk factors, writes policy analyst <strong>Nina Jankowicz</strong> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/opinion/russian-trolls-fake-news.html">a New York Times op-ed</a>.</li>

 <li>The widely followed web-design site <strong>A List Apart</strong> just <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldman/status/956510242015252480">turned 20</a>. Congrats!</li>


  <li>The <strong>Financial Times</strong> web team has been <a href="https://twitter.com/lmirani/status/955799209697071106">having more fun</a> with the site's 404 page than you probably thought they (or anyone at the FT) was capable of.</li>
