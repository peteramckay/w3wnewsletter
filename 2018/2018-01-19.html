<p>We've had a busy week of news in all our key coverage areas around digital independence. Below are all the latest headlines, breaking them down by category.</p>
<p>This is something a little different that we've done in the newsletter previously, so I'm definitely interested to hear your feedback on this format -- good, bad, or inbetween. If you have thoughts, please do <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay">send me a tweet</a>!</p>

<br>

<h1>#privacy</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>By a 65-34 vote, the <strong>U.S. Senate</strong> this week voted to renew for six years a law that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/section-702-renewal-congress-senate-fisa/amp/">gives the National Security Agency broad surveillance powers</a>, including the ability to spy on American citizens. Privacy advocates had hoped to curb these powers, which have been under closer scrutiny since <strong>Edward Snowden</strong>'s leaks in 2013. The renewal now moves on to the <strong>House of Representatives</strong>, which is widely viewed as even more favorable ground for NSA.</li>
      <li>On a happier note from Washington: <strong>Fifty senators</strong>, just one short of a majority, are now committed to a proposed resolution to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/01/15/the-senates-push-to-overrule-the-fcc-on-net-neutrality-now-has-50-votes-democrats-say/">reinstate net neutrality in America</a>, according to the <strong>Washington Post</strong>.</li>

  </ul>

<br>

<h1>#freespeech</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>It's been a rough few days for the news industry -- and the concept of a free press in general. On Jan. 11, <strong>Facebook</strong> publicly announced that it is <a href="https://amp.businessinsider.com/facebooks-updated-news-feed-algorithm-nightmare-for-publishers-2018-1">changing its algorithms</a> to show users more content from their personal contacts and less from organizations, including big publishers. On Tuesday, <strong>The Awl</strong> and its sister site <strong>The Hairpin</strong>, both popular blogs among media pros, announced <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40517329/the-awl-is-shutting-down-and-it-will-be-sorely-missed?partner=feedburner">they will shut down</a> at the end of the month due to flagging business prospects. And on Wednesday, the <strong>Republican National Committee</strong> badmouthed major news organizations in its first <strong>Fake News Awards</strong>, delivering on an earlier (and thoroughly propagandistic) promise by <strong>President Trump</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Vice News</strong> reports that Israeli authorities have increasingly been <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43qq89/israel-is-now-using-facebook-posts-to-jail-palestinians?utm_source=vicenewstwitter">vetting Palestinians' social-media posts</a> for evidence of "incitement" to terrorism. Since 2015, the government has imprisoned 470 Palestinians on such charges.</li>  
    <li><strong>Future Tense</strong>, a joint project by <strong>Slate</strong>, the <strong>New America Foundation</strong>, and <strong>Arizona State University</strong>, announced it hill host a discussion on Jan. 30 titled: "Who's Afraid of Online Speech?" The free event, which will be hosted live at the New America Foundation's Washington headquarters, will also be livestreamed. You can RSVP to attend in-person or virtually <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/future-tense/events/whos-afraid-online-speech/">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Some good news from the Indizr community:</strong> Longtime subscriber <a href="@lawrencepatrick">@lawrencepatrick</a> was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/TimAFranklin/status/933066466416562176">named program director</a> at the San Francisco campus of Northwestern Univerity's <strong>Medill School of Journalism</strong>. Congrats!</li>
    <li>Get ready to hear more <strong>Bob Marley</strong> songs on your favorite music streaming service. Island Records founder <strong>Chris Blackwell</strong>, which has controlled Marley's music publishing since the 1960s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/business/media/bob-marley-primary-wave.html?rref=Indizr-Weekly-Newsletter">has agreed to sell</a> 80 percent of his stake in the Marley catalog, as well as several other artists, to New York's <strong>Primary Wave Music Publishing</strong>. Blackwell, now 80 years old, told the New York Times that his decision was largely motivated by the changes that streaming has brought to the music-publishing business in general.
  </li></ul>

<br>

<h1>#hacking</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Hacker <strong>Dave Winer</strong>, who pioneered the open <strong>Real Simple Syndication</strong> protocol, is hoping that journalists in particular will re-embrace it now that <strong>Facebook</strong> is retreating as a way for users to discover news. He's started <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists">a new project</a> on GitHub to collect feeds journalists should follow for their own everyday work. If you have any ideas, please contribute them! I've already submitted a few myself.</li>
    <li><strong>Red Hat</strong>, a major for-profit provider of Linux services, is dipping its toe into podcasting. The company just launched <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes">Command Line Heroes</a>, which so far focuses on the history of open-source so far. Future episodes will cover active innovators and projects in open source, 
says host <strong>Saron Yitbarek</strong>.</li>
    <li>Speaking of hacking heroes, our new idol is a 78-year-old great-grandmother who goes by the online handle <strong>MaDonna</strong>. Over the last decade, she's developed 17,000 themes for the open-source browser <strong>Firefox</strong>. Full-time staff at the <strong>Mozilla Foundation</strong>, which maintains Firefox, say half-jokingly that <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/06/05/madonna-firefox-theme-designer/?sample_rate=0.001&snippet_name=7706#utm_source=desktop-snippet&utm_medium=snippet&utm_campaign=madona&utm_term=7706&utm_content=rel">she's their lead quality assurance tester</a>.</li>
