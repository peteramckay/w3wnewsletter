# Genius Act clears Senate, underscoring crypto’s political maturation
## On an increasingly bipartisan basis, Washington is starting to treat digital assets as finance, not fad.

**The crypto industry just scored** its first big legislative victory in Washington since contributing heavily to President Trump's election in November.

By a 68-30 vote Tuesday, the Senate [passed the Genius Act](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/genius-stablecoin-bill-crypto.html), which would establish federal guardrails for dollar-pegged stablecoins and create a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars.

Trump immediately urged [quick passage in the House](https://www.theblock.co/post/358821/trump-urges-house-to-pass-genius-stablecoin-bill) as well, so he could sign the measure into law. [But it is unclear](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/18/congress/trump-calls-on-house-gop-to-quickly-adopt-clean-version-of-senate-passed-crypto-bill-00414161) whether that will indeed be the approach of House members. It's possible they could instead focus on advancing a separate bill, dubbed the Stable Act, that has [already passed](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-financial-services-passes-stable-act-stablecoin-bill) the House Financial Services Committee.

Other notable details:

- **Blue defections:** 18 Senate Democrats [voted for the Genius Act](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/democratic-divisions-emerge-congress-tackles-crypto-regulation-rcna212886), splitting with New York's Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is the Senate Democratic leader, and Massachusetts' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a staunch crypto critic. By contrast, only two Senate Republicans -- Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri -- crossed party lines to vote against the bill.

- **The bipartisan Senate vote signals** that a chunk of the Democratic Party is increasingly [willing to move on](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/crypto-stablecoins-senate) from the Biden era's harder line on crypto policy. One potential stumbling block to gaining even wider legislative support, however: The Genius Act places new ethics restrictions on crypto-related conflicts of interest for members of Congress. But those new rules [don't cover the president](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-genuis-act-stablecoin-senate-regulation-2025/), whose family is in fact currently operating several crypto ventures [for their personal enrichment](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/senate-passes-genius-act-criticized-as-gifting-trump-ample-opportunity-to-grift/).

- **Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent** also publicly endorsed the Genius Act, tweeting that [he's optimistic](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1935404649718157691) stablecoins can enhance the U.S. dollar's status as a global reserve currency.

- **Shares in Circle soared** on news of the Genius Act's Senate passage. The USDC issuer's shares are now [up more than sixfold](https://news.google.com/read/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQY21xMTVzTWlxQWVxNjJ3X2xWUGJvd0hZZnBfVWkyUGxUa1NPZkJUMGF3SHpDZzhGelVMTzE1MmtzRkRfdmJFVmhLcWZ6alQ5eEZzcktDSDJCdVJac05VR1dIRHFSazREeUxCM3lVOXVWZzlfZm81U2FZZGU4NExHVkwzRXE5Yl9ERGtUaV9WTVQ0d0VCVmFLU2hZdXZXWkctLUFQbGZpRTdHWlBBeGNnNGhlTWI3dC1VbGZqRndGcnQ0WHdWdjBj?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) since the company's recent IPO on June 5.

**Finally, I think it's relevant to point out** that the Genius Act vote happened *before* this weekend's U.S. military strikes in Iran. It's unclear at this point how that might change the legislative workflow in Congress going forward, perhaps crowding out members' time, energy, and attention to other issues like stablecoins.

Along similar lines, there is also an [increasingly contentious budget bill](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-big-beautiful-bill-poll-2087286) for the entire U.S. government still pending final passage.

But for the time being, crypto world can certainly celebrate a big Washington victory right now. May we all soon return to a world where financial regulation is the thorniest matter that America has to contend with.

### Looking Ahead

- **More crypto-related stock listings are headed to Wall Street.** Justin Sun’s Tron will go public through a [reverse merger with SRM Entertainment](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-group-tron-to-go-public-in-u-s-via-reverse-merger-with-srm-entertainment-598cda51?st=4vje3U&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink), a small Nasdaq-listed toy company... Sol Strategies, a Toronto-based investment firm that holds $72 million of Solana tokens on its balance sheet, filed a proposal with U.S. regualtors to [list its shares](https://decrypt.co/326024/canadian-firm-sol-strategies-files-with-sec-for-nasdaq-debut) on the Nasdaq Capital Market... The trading platform Uphold said it has hired the investment bank FT Partners to explore [its corporate dealmaking options](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/uphold-explores-ipo-and-sale-options/ar-AA1GqzHZ), including a possible IPO or sale to a larger financial institution.

- **The Bitcoin network continues to evolve in fascinating ways**. Reuters reports that Chinese manufacturers with a combined 90% global market share in Bitcoin mining computers are [setting up U.S. production facilities](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/dominant-chinese-makers-bitcoin-mining-machines-set-up-us-production-beat-2025-06-18/) to avoid tariffs...

### Odds & Ends

Aside from airplane flights to cover the non-contiguous states of Hawaii and Alaska, the feat largely entailed flouting posted speed limits while [driving round-the-clock](https://decrypt.co/325960/how-far-would-you-go-pump-meme-coin) in sometimes inclement weather in his Hyundai Kona.
