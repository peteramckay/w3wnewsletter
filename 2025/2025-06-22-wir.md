The US Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that establishes federal guardrails for dollar-pegged stablecoins and creates a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, marks a significant legislative victory for the crypto industry, which invested heavily in the 2024 election cycle.

### Odds & Ends

- **The city of Spokane, Washington,** banned bitcoin ATMs from its streets, ostensibly to prevent crypto scams. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/325791/washington-city-bans-bitcoin-atms-amid-surge-in-crypto-scams))

- **To pump his 50STATES memecoin,** Solana developer Leland King Fawcette just [set a new record](https://x.com/50StatesLIVE/status/1935724462969876602) for fastest solo travel across all 50 U.S. states. Aside from airplane flights to cover the non-contiguous states of Hawaii and Alaska, the feat largely entailed flouting posted speed limits while [driving round-the-clock](https://decrypt.co/325960/how-far-would-you-go-pump-meme-coin) in sometimes inclement weather in his Hyundai Kona.
