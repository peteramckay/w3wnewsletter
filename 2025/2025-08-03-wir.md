**A decade on,** Ethereum in many ways embodies the broader blockchain movement's greatest successes, failures, and the unresolved questions still lurking between the lines.

CNBC calls Ethereum "Wall Street's invisible backbone." https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/02/ethereum-turns-10-from-scrappy-experiment-to-wall-streets-invisible-backbone.html

Think about it: By a wide margin, financial and monetary use cases are where blockchain tech has shined brightest so far, driving the most user adoption.

But it's quite a different picture if you're eager to see a more "web3" version of the future, in which a wider variety of apps that people use everyday across the entire internet begin running on-chain rather than through Big Tech's exploitive platforms. At best, we've made very limited progress toward that vision.

And so it is in particular with Ethereum, which was designed explicitly as an on-chain development platform.  


<!-- Riff on Ethereum's 10th anniversary. -->

- Ethereum has reached a milestone, celebrating its 10-year anniversary with a remarkable 1.2 million percent increase in value since its initial coin offering in 2014. Despite facing numerous challenges, including the DAO hack, regulatory hurdles, and scalability issues, Ethereum has consistently demonstrated its resilience and adaptability, solidifying its position as a foundational platform for the next generation of financial systems. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/364947/10-years-on-ethereum-has-rebuilt-itself-time-and-again-without-compromising-on-its-values-community-members-say)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Ethereum treasury companies have rapidly accumulated over 1% of all circulating ETH in just two months, with some analysts predicting a tenfold growth could push prices past $4,000. This rapid accumulation is attributed to institutions' desire to capitalize on regulatory inefficiencies and potential staking rewards, although Bernstein analysts note that these companies also face unique risks such as liquidity and smart contract risks. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/332281/ethereum-treausry-10-percent-all-eth-standard-chartered)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- SharpLink Gaming, a Minnesota-based Ethereum treasury firm, has significantly increased its Ethereum holdings in July, acquiring $780 million worth of the cryptocurrency and solidifying its position as one of the largest holders of Ethereum. This strategic move is part of the company's plan to boost shareholder value by acquiring more Ethereum per fully diluted share. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/332334/sharplink-gaming-drops-780-million-ethereum-july)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

<!--

- Polygon, a leading Ethereum Layer 2 platform, suffered a one-hour outage due to a consensus bug that occurred when a validator left the network. The bug was promptly patched, and the network has since returned to normal, although users may still experience disruptions accessing various apps due to ongoing RPC issues.

### Five Things: July 27 to Aug. 2, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- Markets: New btc record Friday, etc. Big week for Big Tech earnings: META APPLE MSFT, AMAZON earnings.

- A recent leak of Spotify playlists from tech leaders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has shed light on their musical tastes, with some surprising and humorous revelations. The leaked playlists, which appear to be authentic, offer a glimpse into the personal preferences of influential figures in the tech world, including their favorite artists and songs. https://decrypt.co/333124/sbf-loves-coldplay-crypto-and-ai-leaders-spotify-playlists-leaked <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- US-based spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs experienced significant outflows in early August, with Bitcoin funds shedding nearly $1 billion in combined value and Ethereum funds losing $152.3 million. This reversal comes after a record-breaking month in July, where these funds saw an average of $600 million in inflows per day. https://www.theblock.co/post/365325/us-crypto-etfs-open-august-with-largest-outflows-in-months-following-record-breaking-july <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Circle, the issuer of the popular stablecoin USDC, is facing shrinking margins due to rising distribution costs, according to Mizuho Securities analysts. The analysts estimate that Circle paid over half of its total interest income from USDC reserves to Coinbase, and expect further pressure on Circle's net reserve income margins as payouts ramp up at other distribution partners. https://www.theblock.co/post/365302/coinbases-q2-earnings-point-to-shrinking-usdc-margins-for-circle-mizuho-says <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Crypto exchange volume reached a new high in July, hitting $1.7 trillion, with Binance maintaining the largest market share at $683.41 billion. This surge in trading volume coincided with a broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin posting its highest monthly close in history and Ether seeing a 49.5% rise. https://www.theblock.co/post/365199/crypto-exchange-volume-july <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- The "Big Five" tech companies - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft - all beat Wall Street's second-quarter estimates, with Meta and Apple standing out for their strong revenue growth and Meta's exceptional ad business. While Amazon's profitability guidance fell short of expectations, the companies are all investing heavily in artificial intelligence, with Amazon leading the pack at $115 billion in planned capex for the year. ([Barron's](https://news.google.com/read/CBMifEFVX3lxTE4wb3BsQWg0YzZhSTEwWEQyeUNsQklZV045S20wV2Z5emlOdXV0c3o3VzNMWnYydDJiOGE2cGVleENIdU1QQW1LZm5uY3ViMmE5dm10OWhuYUsxZy1FcFgtTkZzU2lXVGpuUE5BLUFOX0tjSnVxVGEzRmZ0ckI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

 - Bitcoin miners experienced their highest monthly profits since the last halving event in April 2024, with average daily block reward revenue reaching $57,400 per EH/s in July. This profit surge coincided with Bitcoin's record-breaking price of $122,838, but miners still face ongoing challenges such as increased operational costs and mining difficulty. https://decrypt.co/333229/bitcoin-miner-profits-highest-monthly-mark-halving-jp-morgan <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Robinhood's Q2 crypto trading volume jumped 32% year-over-year to $28 billion, driven by the company's push into tokenization and its acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp. The company also reported strong financial results, with diluted earnings of $0.42 per share and quarterly revenue of $989 million, exceeding market estimates. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/364887/robinhoods-q2-crypto-volume-tokenization-bitstamp-deal)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Bakkt is shifting its focus to crypto infrastructure, selling its loyalty division to Project Labrador Holdco for $11 million, and raising $75 million to support its pivot towards digital asset custody, trading, and stablecoin infrastructure. This move is part of the company's broader strategy to double down on core crypto services, including custody and stablecoin payments, and to allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/332368/bakkt-sheds-loyalty-division-as-it-doubles-down-on-crypto)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Despite a $35 billion scam crackdown by US regulators, Telegram-banned marketplaces Huione Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee have reportedly found new life on the platform Tudou Guarantee, which is affiliated with Huione Group. The illicit ecosystem has continued to operate, with some scammers even acquiring new Telegram IDs and channels to evade detection, highlighting the challenges of fully shutting down such complex and resilient networks.

### Looking Ahead

- **Some CEOs have begun bragging publicly** about AI-driven job cuts. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/layoff-business-strategy-reduce-staff-11796d66?st=2QS96N&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- **OpenAI updates:**& OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has expressed concerns about the capabilities of their upcoming AI model, GPT-5, describing it as feeling "very fast" and even comparing it to the Manhattan Project. Altman's comments highlight the potential risks and power dynamics surrounding the development of advanced AI, raising questions about responsibility and governance in the industry.  ([TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/chatgpt/openais-ceo-says-hes-scared-of-gpt-5)) | OpenAI is planning to launch its next-generation GPT-5 model in early August, which will integrate the o3 reasoning capabilities and be available through ChatGPT and the OpenAI API. The launch is expected to include mini and nano versions of the model, with the main combined reasoning version available through ChatGPT and the API. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad)) | OpenAI has introduced a new "study mode" feature within its ChatGPT platform, designed to help students learn and work through problems step-by-step rather than relying on the chatbot for direct answers. This feature, which is available to all users, aims to improve learning and reduce the risk of students using AI tools to cheat. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/openai-announces-new-study-mode-product-for-students-.html)) | OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent has successfully navigated Cloudflare's anti-bot verification process, a common security checkpoint on the web, by clicking through a two-step verification process while narrating its actions. This achievement highlights the agent's advanced browser automation capabilities and raises questions about the effectiveness of CAPTCHAs in preventing automated programs from accessing websites.

- Cboe BZX and NYSE Arca have proposed new listing standards for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), aiming to streamline the approval process and reduce the time it takes for these products to go public. The proposed standards would allow crypto ETFs to list and trade under a standard framework, potentially cutting down the review period from up to 240 days to just 21 days or less.
