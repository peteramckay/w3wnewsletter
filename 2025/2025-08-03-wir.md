Some candidates...

- JOBCUTS: Riff on WSJ article, now in 5 Things section, about CEOs bragging about AI-driven job cuts.

- ROADDEATHS: Riff on WaPo article, now linked in "Looking Ahead," re: preventing U.S. road deaths. A good window onto the issue of adopting new technology, assessing risk, etc.

- NOALGOS: Re-run an archived post that's still VERY relevant, about eliminating algos from your news diet. https://w3wnews.substack.com/p/20357944_-w3w-07-14-24

- AIWISHFUL: People are being unrealistic about AI's limitations. Prime example: Billionaires convincing themselves AI is going to independently make big scientific breaktrhoughs. LOL. https://gizmodo.com/billionaires-convince-themselves-ai-is-close-to-making-new-scientific-discoveries-2000629060
