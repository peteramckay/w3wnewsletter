### Five Things: May 11-17, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- The US Copyright Office has released a pre-publication report challenging the idea that all AI training on copyrighted works should be considered fair use, citing concerns about market disruption and potential harm to creators. The report, which has sparked controversy in the tech industry, suggests that some AI training may be deemed fair use, but only if it is transformative and does not compete with original creative works. ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/copyright-office-head-fired-after-reporting-ai-training-isnt-always-fair-use/)) <!-- Drafted by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B. Could potentially flesh this one out as lead item for the newsletter -->

- eToro, a fintech company and digital trading platform, has made its highly anticipated Nasdaq debut with its shares trading under the ticker "ETOR" at a price of $52 per share. The company's IPO raised around $310 million, valuing eToro at approximately $4.2 billion, after initially planning to sell shares between $46 and $50 apiece.

- New bitcoin ATH? <!-- A possibility this week-->

- Ethereum surging! <!-- Wassup with that? A good candidate for lead item. -->

- Robinhood buying Wonderfi <!-- Link TK -->

- Alexander Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme that saw him make $48 million by manipulating the price of Celsius' proprietary token and selling his own tokens at inflated prices. His scheme, which involved using slogans like "Unbank Yourself" to persuade customers to invest, ultimately led to Celsius filing for bankruptcy in 2022 with around $25 billion in assets.

- As researchers develop more advanced biohybrid robots, also known as cyborgs, by merging living organisms with mechanical parts, concerns are rising about the ethics of using animals for human purposes. With the possibility of creating tiny flying drones or robots that mimic insects, the question of whether we have the right to control and modify living creatures for our benefit, especially when they may be capable of feeling pain or having preferences, is becoming increasingly important.
