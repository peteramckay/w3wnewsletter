### Five Things: July 13-19, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **President Trump signed into law the Genius Act,** which sets clearer rules for stablecoins in the U.S. It is the first major piece of crypto-related legislation to gain full passage in Trump's second term. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/18/trump-signs-stablecoin-bill-into-law-genius))

- **Ether's price is surging,** recently posting a 7-day gain [of 26%](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Wall Street institutions are increasingly either [buying exchange-traded funds](https://www.theblock.co/post/363070/ether-rises-spot-eth-etfs-highest-ever-net-inflows) linked to the token or integrating it into their corporate cash reserves -- strategies that previously benefited bitcoin. [Decrypt's Andr√© Beganski notes](https://decrypt.co/330896/bitcoin-dominance-sinks-as-ethereum-xrp-rise) that bitcoin's share of the global crypto market, which has been historically high throughout 2025, has even begun to ease off recently due to the rally in ETH and other tokens. So-called "bitcoin dominance" in the overall crypto market dipped below 61% over the weekend, compared to recent highs near 66%.

- **The Bitcoin network's core developers** patched a five-year-old bug that could be used by attackers to log needless data to a computer acting as a network node. The vulnerability left individual nodes susceptible to slower verification of Bitcoin transactions, or even outright crashes. ([Protos](https://protos.com/bitcoin-core-devs-finally-patch-5-year-old-disk-fill-bug/))

- **Jack Dorsey's payments company Block,** which was among the first to offer crypto trading to mainstream smartphone users, is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index Wednesday. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/block-shares-soar-on-entry-into-sp-500.html))

- **Southern California police** who have been investigating a 74-year-old man's disappearance in May now suspect foul play related to his son's crypto fortune. Yikes. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/330828/california-sheriffs-believe-74-year-olds-disappearance-linked-sons-crypto-fortune))

### Looking Ahead

- **Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster** said the retail brokerage giant will add crypto trading soon. The move will put Schwab in direct competition with Coinbase for individual investors' business. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-ceo-says-crypto-131401670.html))

- **The British government is planning to sell** its trove of crypto seized from criminals across several cases in recent years. The stash includes more than $7 billion in bitcoin. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/363489/uk-home-office-working-towards-sale-of-7-billion-seized-btc-stockpile-the-telegraph))

- **Wall Street Journal tech columnist Nicole Nguyen** recommends readers [don't buy a new iPhone](https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-buying-guide-summer-2025-2ab4d8ad?st=AuqQ5Z&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) this summer. Better to wait for updates in September, she says.

### Odds & Ends

- **The New York Times recently profiled Library180,** a nonprofit public space in Lower Manhattan dedicated to [preserving print media](https://news.google.com/read/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPSDhHTUh5c0pNYkUwaE5US2FKZGN5YUY5ejlVWjE1X3AtQVlVOWduQUFyeUlxNFVSWVZaZFYyVVRpNnh2aWtpdS1ZZXh2aVp2SERYVTRsNExRWjRLYXdIU2hJRlBDNW5lZFo1NEtiWXRnaWFuckJsYmFKNjM1NXFIR3hXR0pFQkFfOTl2WmtjZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). Its specialties so far are glossy fashion magazines and alternative newspapers, many provided from the two founders' decades-long personal collections. Wow.

- **In a post to to his YouTube channel,** astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson summarized the evidence suggesting our universe may be located [inside a black hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKeCr-MAyH4).
