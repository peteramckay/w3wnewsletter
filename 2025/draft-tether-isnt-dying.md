**You will never hear me deny that crypto bulls** sometimes make cartoonishly triumphant claims and predictions. These are easy to spot (and mock) whenever bitcoin's price [doesn't zoom to $1 million per token](https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-coinbase-cto-makes-2m-bet-on-bitcoin-s-performance) within a 90-day timeframe, for instance.

That said, some crypto bears' doomsaying strikes me as comparably outlandish at this point. But bears tend to get away with their whoppers more readily because, frankly, the mainstream press is more sympathetic to them.

One perennial favorite of theirs is forecasting the demise of Tether, issuer of the most widely used dollar-pegged stablecoin. Just to cite a few examples:

- NYT
- Zeke
- Commissioner Gordon

Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns

Problems:

- Overestimating preventive power of regulation: https://www.wired.com/story/tether-celsius-crypto-lawsuit-close-call/

- Overestimating the importance of the US vs the rest of the world:

- Underestimating the power of market validation (or invalidation) of what's a fraud.


<!--

Start with the gross overgeneralization that crypto is *all* a fraud, not a marketplace that sometimes has individual bad actors who are exceptions to the norm, as happens in stocks or real estate or any other asset.

Truly, wherever you find people and money, you will find people trying to screw other people out of money. Unfortunately, this is a feature of human beings, not something unique to crypto or any other investment.

Overestimating the preventive power of agency regulation and underestimating the importance of market-based validation.

At some point, critics' assertions that crypto is all going to vanish have to be considered as delusional as anything the bulls make.

Zeke Fawkes and Batman actors books dedicated long passages to predicting Tether's doom.
