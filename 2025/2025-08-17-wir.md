# Cut the algos from your news diet.
## It’s one of the best things we could all do to have better small-d democratic discourse. Here’s how I do it.

**When I consume news online these days,** I try to do so in channels with little or no algorithmic curation whenever possible.

The main things I look for instead are feeds organized in [reverse chronological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_chronology#:~:text=Reverse%20chronology%20is%20a%20narrative,the%20conclusion%20to%20the%20plot.) order and news sources edited and curated by (gasp!) actual humans. Tools that fit into these categories for me include:
- **Email newsletters.** Our inboxes are perhaps the original example of reverse chronology, with everything organized simply by timestamp. Then, within each newsletter (like this one), you’re usually getting one actual person’s curated view of the world. If you get several different perspectives in this way, even better. Bingo.
- **RSS.** Yes, this [old standby](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/) from the early days of the blogosphere still works. My daily feed reader is [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), but there are several others out there you might choose. When you build your own subscription list in one of these things, that itself is a form of human curation.
- **Podcasts, downloaded via my desktop podcatcher.** The qualifier in that description is really important, as the podcatcher is what cuts out the algos for me, leaving a simple reverse chronology. As a user of the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) operating system on my desktop PC, I use the default audio app [Rhythmbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmbox) for curating my podcasts. (I can also move the downloaded audio files over to my mobile devices if necessary with Rhythmbox.) What you probably don’t want to use, however, is something more platform-y like Spotify or Stitcher. Those are more aggressively (and algorithmically) curated, in my experience.
- **News organizations’ bespoke sites and apps.** Again, a somewhat old-school option here. But the plus side is that these things usually don’t have much algorithmic curation, except perhaps  for the occasional “most read stories” list or something that’s similarly pretty simple. Where the news orgs have generally been more experimental is in story presentation, design, and multimedia experience. But even with those features, you’re still getting the creative vision of human reporters and editors, not robots trying to target you with ads.
- **The Brave web browser.** I will give this one an honorable mention on the list because I find its [default privacy safeguards](https://brave.com/) protect me well against algorithmically targeted advertising in particular. That’s not exactly pertinent to the matter of prioritizing feeds of news headlines. But it is broadly related to the theme of breaking from the major platforms’ surveillance-driven business models.

So what do I cut out of my daily setup in order to make room for the above? Well, as you can probably guess, I’m generally spending less time on social media these days, and I specifically try not to use it as a news source. When I’m on social, I’m much more apt to post personal updates or maybe reply to a person I know offline who’s posted something that caught my eye.

But social simply isn’t a primary news source for me anymore, because it’s clearly pretty crappy at that particular job. This is true precisely *because* social platforms usually lean too heavily on algos that tend to make us [angrier and more extreme](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/friction/201807/why-social-media-makes-us-angrier-and-more-extreme), but not necessarily better informed.

It's more profitable for them that way.

That said, I will admit my alternative solution is also imperfect in some ways. True math geeks might argue, for example, that reverse chronology is itself a sort of algorithm, albeit a much simpler one than the social platforms’ inscrutable black boxes for prioritizing our feeds.

There’s also no single set of rules anyone could come up with that could possibly cover every single social platform out there, with all the different features and interfaces you might choose within each app, and so on. The possibilities are just too vast to cover so easily.

Nevertheless, I find the approach I described above works pretty well for me, in general. And I’m motivated to share it because, frankly, the [awful political news in the U.S.](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-taken-off-stage-after-apparent-shots-fired-at-rally-9d6680da?st=67c2iu2yhajek5q&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) this weekend is front of mind for me right now. Helping people become better news consumers is a constructive change we should talk about in its wake, I believe.

On our Sunday political shows today, there was [a lot of talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkBaKOW-OOo) about the need for politicians to “dial back” their rhetoric. It has undoubtedly grown very heated over the years and perhaps prone to encourage disturbed individuals to conduct attacks like the one against former President Trump on Saturday evening.

I fully agree, our elected officials need to set a better tone. But I would add: Each of us, as news consumers, need to do our part as well to inoculate ourselves against all the rhetorical poison that circulates on the tech platforms, day by day.

That way, even if some miscreant circulates hate or incitement online, its broader effect on society is limited. It can become like the proverbial tree that falls in the forest with no one around to hear it.

Sure, it would be nice if the people running social platforms did the work to protect us from such stuff. But we should have learned from repeated [experience](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043377310/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-congress) by now, that’s simply not going to happen. Not in the real world that we actually live in.

We’re on our own in this regard. Act accordingly.

### Five Things: Aug. 10-16, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- New open-source AGI framework from Sentient. https://cointelegraph.com/news/sentient-ai-search-outperforms-gpt4o-perplexity ([]())

- **Crypto markets ran hot and cold.** New ETH records (and BTC?) early in the weak. But then renewed worries about wholesale-level U.S. inflation squelched the buying on Friday. <!-- Some headlines about this mid-week. Keep an eye out through Friday's close for any necessary market updates in the Sunday email blast. --> https://www.theblock.co/post/366699/spot-ethereum-etfs-524-million-inflows | https://www.theblock.co/post/366689/ethereum-foundation-offloads-13-million-worth-eth ([]())

- Fed relaxes crypto oversight: https://decrypt.co/335488/fed-ends-supervisory-program-bank-crypto-bitcoin | The American Bankers Association and over 50 state banking groups are urging Congress to close loopholes in the recently enacted GENIUS Act, warning that the lack of clear regulations could trigger a massive deposit flight from traditional banking to stablecoin issuers. This shift could disrupt the flow of credit to businesses and households, increasing lending costs and reducing loans, according to the coalition. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/334930/bank-groups-urge-us-senate-to-close-gaps-in-countrys-new-stablecoin-law)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | ([]())

- The Norway sovereign wealth fund's indirect bitcoin exposure has grown significantly, reaching 7,161 BTC ($862.8 million) as of June 30, primarily due to its investments in companies like Strategy, Block, Coinbase, MARA, and Metaplanet. This exposure represents a 87.7% increase in the past six months and 192.7% over the past year, highlighting the growing mainstream acceptance of bitcoin in diversified portfolios. https://www.theblock.co/post/366752/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-bitcoin-exposure ([]())

### Looking Ahead

- OpenAI's GPT-5 is being used to provide health advice to users, despite the risks of people relying on the AI model without consulting a doctor. This raises concerns about accountability, as tech companies may not be liable for the harm caused by their AI models, which can perpetuate errors or biases in their training data.   ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/12/1121565/what-you-may-have-missed-about-gpt-5/))

- **AI-generated mistakes in judicial decisions are raising concerns about the reliability and legitimacy of the justice system.** Judges are worried that relying on AI tools could lead to incorrect or misleading decisions, which could have serious consequences in cases like child custody or bail proceedings, and potentially erode public trust in the courts. ([MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/08/11/1121460/meet-the-early-adopter-judges-using-ai/))

- **Crypto asset-management firm Grayscale has registered** new entities with Delaware regulators to offer exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the Cardano and Hedera tokens. Such state-level filings are likely a precursor to registering more detailed proposals for such ETFs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/366692/grayscale-cardano-hedera-etf-delaware))

### Odds & Ends

- **Scientists in South Africa** have begun injecting rhinos' horns with mildly radioactive isotopes to deter poaching. The injections are safe for the animals but are easily detectable at airports and borders, thus helpful for arresting traffickers. ([National Public Radio](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/01/nx-s1-5488737/scientists-south-africa-rhino-horns-radioactive-poaching))

- **A University of Georgia geologist** has determined that a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home outside Atlanta in June is 20 million years older than earth. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meteorite-georgia-nasa-earth/))
