Jesus Rodriguez, CEO of the institutional DeFi platform IntoTheBlock, just sounded an important alarm. In [an essay](https://news.google.com/read/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9LVm9rbkFKWGRIYnlLcUZiWlNqdWZUYWFVbXRhaWlQZC1taEpRNlJ4bjRWUHZ2UkNqUXJpa2VYZ2tabF9nc1FNX1pBMmxNVEpyQmhkenotbmFsOHlnS1lOX0JKRzZnbVc3R2lPdnJVak1Za2pheWg3UUFWYVZnM0U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) for CoinDesk, he writes:

>*"AI innovation is compounding rapidly, and Web3 has been a passive observer. None of the major AI milestonesâ€”unsupervised pretraining, advanced fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning engines, or agentic frameworksâ€”have involved Web3 architectures in a meaningful way.*
>
>*"As each new release compounds on the last, the barriers to catching up become steeper. All critical tooling, platforms, and infrastructure for building frontier models are currently centralized. Without urgent, coordinated efforts to change this trajectory, Web3-AI will be left decades behind in a field that advances in months."*


a platform focused on enabling market intelligence and institutional DeFi solutions for crypto markets.


He is also the co-founder and President of Faktory, a generative AI platform for business and consumer apps. Jesus also founded The Sequence, one of the most popular AI newsletters in the world. In addition to his operational work, Jesus is a guest lecturer at Columbia University and Wharton Business School and is a very active writer and speaker.
