# Considering the Free World ex America
## Even sans a certain superpower, the combined capabilities of global democracies may be more than we think.

*<strong>We'll lead off with something a little different this time:</strong> A guest post from Jon Shell, chairman of [Social Capital Partners](https://socialcapitalpartners.ca/), a Toronto nonprofit that seeks to expand wealth-building opportunities and social mobility in Canada.*

*I've done only some light copyediting below to Jon's [original post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7301360821714960384) on LinkedIn. It immediately struck me as worth sharing with the w3w audience given the week's seismic geopolitical events, the increasing role of Silicon Valley in U.S. politics, and the repercussions that could yet come for the global tech industry.*

*As an American, I'll also say that now feels like a good time to turn the mic over to a neighbor and just listen a minute. At least some of us still know how to do that. -- PM*

**Europe seems ready to lead again. Canada wants in.**

As if we needed another reason, watching Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zalensky beaten up in the White House has to be the last straw. Watching the United Kingdom's prime minister groveling at Donald Trump's feet. Watching my entire country suffer a constant sense of anxiety and doom, refreshing their screens for news of the latest attack.

Thereâ€™s no sense pretending that NATO, NORAD, the UN or any other organizations where America is the most powerful voice matter anymore.

We need something new.

750 million people. 34% of the global economy. Vast resources, powerful military, industrial and nuclear capacity, and some of the worldâ€™s most powerful companies.

Thatâ€™s what you get when you combine the European Union, Japan, Canada, the UK, South Korea, and Australia. Bigger, richer, and with more resources than the U.S. Able to stand up to aggression from anyone.

This needs to be the new project.

There is no balance in todayâ€™s world. We canâ€™t sit around and wait to see what happens, hoping it ends in four years. Because it might not â€“ what happens if Trump is followed by eight years of J.D. Vance? Whatâ€™s left at the end of that?

This new bloc wasnâ€™t possible in 1945. America was key. And as long as our alliances held, there was no reason to change.

But itâ€™s different now. Canada, Germany, and Japan might not have had a lot in common 80 years ago, but we do now. Market-based economies. High per-capita incomes. Socialized health care. A commitment to the safety of our residents. A new bloc is possible, with as many shared values and beliefs as we ever had with the U.S.

America kept us all safe for a long time. We got complacent. But the world doesnâ€™t need to hang on the American Presidentâ€™s every word. The rest of us are big, strong, and rich. And it is as plain as this: The world as we know it simply cannot survive an America that is as powerful as this, and that acts like this. Without a new bloc strong enough to rival America, there are simply no guarantees.

I get it -- we're Canada. We need to trade with the U.S. That's fine. Germany bought gas from Russia before they invaded Ukraine, and everyone trades with China. It won't be easy, but some deal on trade will happen. This is bigger than trade. This is about saving the world we recognize.

Itâ€™s not an overnight project. It may take a decade to put all the pieces together. But if we don't start now, it may soon be too late.
