*<strong>Before we begin,</strong> a big thank-you to the paid subscribers who help the w3w newsletter bring readers the latest news about Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI, and other emerging tech. I'm glad to maintain a free distribution tier as well, to make this information available more widely.

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_

 _**If you need to reach me directly for any reason, please email peter[at]w3w[dot]media.**_

 _**Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_ ðŸ˜Š
