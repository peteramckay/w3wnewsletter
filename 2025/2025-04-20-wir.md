For this version, I had NotebookLM and Copilot take a crack at rewriting the news summary items in the "Five Things" section that Leo/Llama 3.1 drafted earlier.

Didn't really find 9 of the 10 NotebookLM results useful in this case tbh. But it did surface the LiveWire article on quantum computing that I've now added to the summaries.

For the entire cohort of summary items, I found Copilot did a better rewrite job based on this prompt:

Copilot, the attached markdown file is a draft of my weekly weekly newsletter about emerging technolgies. In the "Five Things" section are some news summary items I had another AI draft for me. Could you please edit them for clarity, spelling, grammar, flow, and, where possible based on your training data, factual accuracy? Each item should be 1-3 sentences in length.

Copilot's revised summary items are copied below verbatim in the "Five Things" section. I've also preserved the Leo versions, commented out, for the sake of preserving the links better.

Will manually edit myself from here in the next commit. - PM
