**Slate's Stephen Harrison** recently [highlighted](https://slate.com/technology/2025/04/trump-news-2025-stock-market-crash-wikipedia-controversy.html) a fascinating debate among Wikipedia editors -- whether the tariff-driven plunge in the U.S. stock market constitutes a historic "crash" or a more mundane "decline."

So far, "crash" has been carrying the day in the pertinent market-related [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_stock_market_crash). But as with everything in the community-maintained encyclopedia, that could change in the future.

Harrison notes some interesting dynamics at play:

<blockquote>

  *As with other debates on Wikipedia, there are basically two camps: On one side, we have the archivists, editors who believe that Wikipedia‚Äôs role is akin to that of traditional encyclopedias, which only included entries that were thought to have a long-term historical significance. The archivists point to the policy that Wikipedia is not a newspaper that should cover all current events, only those that are truly encyclopedic. Wikipedia‚Äôs archivists tend to be rather cautious and conservative about framing. It‚Äôs not known yet whether the events of April 2025 will linger in the historical memory like Black Thursday (1929), Black Monday (1987), the Flash Crash (2010), and the COVID-19 crash (2020). The archivists argue that until we have a clearer picture, Wikipedia should refrain from calling this a ‚Äúcrash‚Äù because it‚Äôs too politically contentious.*

  *Standing opposite of the archivists are the updaters, the Wikipedians who believe the site‚Äôs articles should reflect the current media and public framing of significant events. They point to Wikipedia‚Äôs explicit policy that it‚Äôs not a paper encyclopedia like the days of yore, but rather a digital encyclopedia project. There‚Äôs no need to delay changes until some distant future print run; the whole point of a wiki is that you can always make an edit. Quick changes are helpful because the reality is that readers are visiting Wikipedia (or accessing the same info via A.I. tools) because they want information about these events in real time.*

</blockquote>

**For what it's worth,** speaking as someone who covered multiple market crashes over 11 years at the Wall Street Journal, we used to have a rule of thumb: A "crash" is traditionally a single-day decline of 10% or more.

That said, the rule wasn't absolute. Market drops that were very rapid and historic, but didn't necessarily meet the "10% in one day" criterion, were also sometimes referred to as "crashes." The decline of the Nasdaq Composite Index beginning in March 2000 when the first dotcom bubble burst fit the latter standard, for example. Hence the Journal has frequently referred to it as a "crash" ever since.

This month's decline in the S&P 500 clearly seems to fit a similar bill, in my opinion. No, the index hasn't had a one-day 10% drop. But from April 3, when trading began after President Trump announced across-the-board tariffs on imports into the U.S., until the market's recent low on April 8, the S&P [fell 12%](https://www.wsj.com/finance/will-the-last-investor-to-leave-america-please-turn-out-the-lights-cdf727b4?st=FckdHs&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink).

A drop of that magnitude in just four trading days is plenty rapid [by historical standards](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/19/sp-500-12th-biggest-4-day-decline-75-years-history/). And it was driven in this case by a seismic change in economic policy that reverses decades of American preference to make trade more open over time, not less.

As far as I'm concerned, yes, that's easily enough to call it a crash.  

### Five Things: April 13-19, 2025

The week's most important headlines in emerging tech:

- **Troubling signs on AI-powered disinformation:** Researchers say a sprawling Russian disinformation network, dubbed "Pravda," has been [seeding](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250310-russian-disinformation-infects-ai-chatbots-researchers-warn) popular large language models with pro-Kremlin propaganda... Meanwhile, OpenAI has [revised its AI safety policy](https://fortune.com/2025/04/16/openai-safety-framework-manipulation-deception-critical-risk/), dropping pre-release testing requirements for persuasive or manipulative capabilities. The company is also [prototyping](https://decrypt.co/315020/openai-plans-x-like-social-platform-amid-ongoing-rift-musk) a social network that could compete with Twitter/X, according to the Verge's Kylie Robison and Alex Heath.

- **Investor sentiment on crypto's ruling duo remains bullish despite turbulence on Wall Street.**  Google searches for the terms "Bitcoin" and "Ethereum" have [surged to 2025 highs](https://www.theblock.co/post/351053/retail-curiosity-is-rekindled-as-google-search-volume-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-jumps), reflecting growing public interest in crypto... Meanwhile, new research from CoinDesk Indeces suggests instutitions are showing [an increasing preference](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/04/16/bitcoin-leads-a-fundamental-shift-in-the-crypto-market) for bitcoin over any alternatives, driving the token's market share higher. So-called "bitcoin dominance" in the global token market now stands at 63%, its highest level since early 2021, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).

- **But worry is mounting about the long-term quantum threat to Bitcoin.** Project 11 announced a new $85,000 bounty to test if quantum computers can break the Bitcoin network's encryption...


The challenge focuses on a simplified version of Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography, and experts warn that a quantum computer could potentially crack the encryption, allowing hackers to steal funds. This highlights the need for Bitcoin developers to prepare for a quantum future and develop new, quantum-resistant solutions to protect user funds. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/315288/bitcoin-quantum-computing-bounty-encryption)) | *Quantum Computing TKTK:* *Scientists Observe Elusive Quantum Phenomenon* Researchers have successfully observed a new quantum phase, called a superradiant phase transition (SRPT), which was first predicted over 50 years ago. This phenomenon, resulting from the coordinated fluctuation of two groups of quantum particles, could have significant implications for quantum computing, sensors, and communication technology. The discovery could lead to more stable and precise quantum measurements and computations.
