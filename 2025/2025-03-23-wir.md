<!-- 150-word lead item. Some possibilities...

- UNCOOL: Riff on Winkie's rant in Slate about the "uncoolness" of Trump II. This could also be a social post.

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_

 _**Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_ ðŸ˜Š
