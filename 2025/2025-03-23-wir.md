*<strong>Before we begin,</strong> a big thank-you to the paid subscribers who help the w3w newsletter bring readers the latest news about Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI, and other emerging tech. I'm glad to maintain a free distribution tier as well, to make this information available more widely. But if you're able, please do consider upgrading to a paid plan [on Substack](https://w3wnews.substack.com/subscribe).* ðŸ˜Š

**Call me Ishmael.** Yadda yadda yadda.   

<!-- 150-word lead item. Some possibilities...

- UNCOOL: Riff on Winkie's rant in Slate about the "uncoolness" of Trump II. This could also be a social post.

- CARR: Riff on AoM intvu with author Nicholas Carr re: some of the downsides of digital communication. This could also fit in the news roundup, perhaps in odds & ends: https://www.artofmanliness.com/people/relationships/podcast-1054-familiarity-breeds-contempt-and-other-underappreciated-consequences-of-digital-communication/

- BOYCOTTS: Why withholding money from a publicly traded company works. You only need to deny marginal metrics, not move them to zero in absolute terms.

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_

 _**If you need to reach me directly for any reason, please email peter[at]w3w[dot]media.**_

 _**Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_ ðŸ˜Š
