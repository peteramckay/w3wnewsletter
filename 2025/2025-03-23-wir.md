## New research project is seeking volunteers to help sniff it out.

**The Markup and Consumer Reports are partnering** on what sounds like a really interesting research project regarding a new form of user surveillance for social networks.

In a [new post](https://hackernoon.com/you-can-help-us-investigate-surveillance-marketing-using-facebook-data-heres-how?source=rss) to HackerNoon, the Markup explains this new tracking methodology:

<blockquote>

  <p><em>Instead of relying on tracking pixels‚Äîwhich is web traffic that The Markup, Consumer Reports, and others can detect using tools in the browser‚Äîcompanies may now be tracking you in a way that‚Äôs completely undetectable by users and their devices.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs called ‚Äúserver-to-server tracking,‚Äù which essentially means that when companies get some information about you, their servers send it directly to another company‚Äôs server. Privacy research tools often rely on certain signals from your computer, mobile device, or browser to detect tracking. But ‚Äúserver-to-server tracking‚Äù doesn‚Äôt emit any of these sorts of signals.</p></em>

</blockquote>

To get a clearer picture of what Meta in particular is up to in this regard, the Markup and Consumer Reports are [seeking volunteers](https://hackernoon.com/you-can-help-us-investigate-surveillance-marketing-using-facebook-data-heres-how?source=rss) to share their Facebook data. Then the news orgs plan to backward engineer what Meta seems to know about users that it otherwise wouldn't if it weren't tracking them server-to-server method.

This is a big ask, no doubt. But I just want to amplify their call to action as it seems like a worthy effort by a couple of very credible news orgs.

I know I'm not the only one who's already very curious to see what this project finds by the time it's done.

### Odds & Ends

- **An Australian man with heart failure** has become the first person in the world to survive more than 100 days with an artificial titanium heart. ([Al Jazeera](https://aje.io/8vytwy))

- **"Times are tough on Sesame Street."** The venerable children's show is facing an expiring contract with HBO, declining support from the U.S. government, and rising ratings competition from shows such as Bluey. ([New York Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQZDdaSDhsUV9pVHVMcVpWbUw2RGJOYVRmTHRNZlZkYVNBLXNzVl9IZlFzd3FwT1YtUVEwRXlIZzRXWHJJdHFGTFJ6WVFFcURVc3pfTF9HS2p2WUhMZVlWWlU1SjY1YTF0VkxQWDNWbmNSNmEtQ3BxeUZ0VXFxT2IyV1pvWEF2Nm85emM5a3pMYVZmNDA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **But things could be worse.** A British court this month rejected early bitcoiner James Howells' request to excavate a Wales landfill that he believes contains an old hard drive that his ex-girlfriend discarded in 2013. It contained the keys to his bitcoin wallet holding tokens now worth almost $700 million.
