**American AI companies' scramble for access** to scarce chips and power is heating up:

- OpenAI [partnered with Broadcom](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-taps-broadcom-build-its-first-ai-processor-latest-chip-deal-2025-10-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)<!-- Article curated and summarized by ChatGPT--> to build its first custom processor.

- **Meanwhile, rival Meta struck a pair of new deals.** Along with Blue Owl, it [raised $30 billion](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/telcos-media-tech/meta-blue-owl-seal-us30-billion-private-capital-deal-ai)<!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini --> to build a new data center in Louisiana.

The deal includes a $1.5 billion investment to build a new AI data center in Texas.

- The Wall Street Journal's Jennifer Hiller reports that America should be adding about 80 gigawatts of new power generation capacity a year to keep pace with the growth of AI and other tech applications. But it’s currently building less than 65 gigawatts a year. As a result, AI data centers are increasingly [building on-site generation](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/ai-data-centers-desperate-for-electricity-are-building-their-own-power-plants-291f5c81?st=iCbEVn&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)<!-- Link curated by me--> as a workaround to the existing U.S. power grid.

- **Google's parent Alphabet announced** a new $24 billion round of investment in AI infrastructure, most of it in India. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-plans-to-invest-9-billion-to-expand-ai-infrastructure-b0a88e0f?st=U4u4sT&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)) <!-- Story surfaced by ChatGPT.

<!-- Riff on need to take a nuanced view of AI -->

- **A new study published in the *Harvard Business Review* exposed a growing phenomenon called "workslop,"** which is defined as AI-generated content that lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a task. The report found that over 40% of US employees receive such content, leading researchers to conclude that rushed AI deployment without proper training is "destroying productivity." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/ai-workslop-us-employees), Oct. 12, 2025) <!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini -->

- The Wikimedia Foundation has reported an 8% decline in human traffic to Wikipedia between May and August 2025, citing the rise of search engines and chatbots providing direct access to Wikipedia content without sending users to the site. This trend, attributed to the growing use of generative AI and social media, has significant implications for the future of online publishing and the sustainability of content creation.

  OpenAI has temporarily suspended generation of videos featuring the civil-rights leader on its “Sora 2” video-creation tool after outrage from the King Estate and others over “disrespectful” user-generated deepfakes. The company now says it will let estates and authorised representatives opt-out of their likenesses being used. ([The Verge][1]) <!-- Link surfaced and summarized by ChagGPT. -->

- **Experts warn that the growing use of AI in clinical settings could create an intractable "blame game" for medical failings.** The introduction of AI-powered tools for diagnosis and care raises complex legal issues, as patients may face significant barriers in demonstrating fault due to a lack of transparency into the AI's internal workings and a challenge in proposing a reasonable alternative design. The report, which came out of a summit hosted by the *Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)*, highlights the need for dedicated funding to properly assess AI tool performance in real-world clinical use.

- **The deployment of "agentic AI" is accelerating, with robots and automated systems now operating completely autonomously in major enterprises.** Companies like Amazon are integrating over 1,000 AI-based services, and an AI agent for a major financial services firm reportedly increased claims won by 13% with "no human in the loop". This shift, which also includes countries like Albania giving an AI a seat at the cabinet table, has raised the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) estimate of jobs "highly exposed to AI" to 40% globally and 60% in industrialized nations.

- **Oracle Stock Drops Amid Investor Concerns Over OpenAI Revenue Reliance** Shares of Oracle sank after its quarterly update, despite projecting robust sales growth, as some Wall Street analysts expressed concerns about the company's reliance on revenue from OpenAI and other major customers for its AI infrastructure buildout. The company is collaborating with OpenAI and SoftBank on the "Stargate" AI infrastructure project, and the market reaction highlights volatility surrounding the concentrated nature of generative AI spending.

### Week in Review: Oct. 12-18, 2025

- A recent $19 billion liquidation event in the cryptocurrency market has sparked a debate among experts about the feasibility of implementing circuit breakers in decentralized finance (DeFi) to mitigate market volatility. Experts argue that traditional circuit breakers, which have been effective in traditional finance, may not be suitable for DeFi due to its decentralized nature and the constant arbitrage across venues.

- **Markets:** Big selloff underway coming into the week. Some even calling it a "crash." Check for updates as needed Friday.  ([]()) **Bitcoin's price experienced extreme volatility,** with a record single-day liquidation event briefly sending it below the $110,000 mark. Despite the market shock, institutional demand remains robust, with BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) approaching $100 billion in assets under management, underscoring the duality of growing mainstream investment and continued market fragility.

 | The recent decline in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP experiencing significant drops, has sparked debate among analysts about the relevance of the traditional four-year cycle rulebook. Some experts believe that retail traders are still following this cycle, leading to sell-offs, while others argue that the crypto landscape has evolved beyond it due to growing institutional adoption and changes in the industry. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/344818/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-bleed-traders-weigh-end-4-year-cycle))  Article curated by me, summarized by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B  | A recent surge in volatility in the cryptocurrency market was triggered by a potential 100% tariff on Chinese imports, leading to approximately $18 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. This event, combined with uncertainty around US-China trade policy, highlights the growing risks and volatility associated with digital assets. ([Lowenstein Crypto](https://www.lowenstein.com/news-insights/newsletters/crypto-brief-october-16-2025)) Article curated by me, summarized by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B  | A dramatic crypto flash crash on October 10, 2025, saw Bitcoin plummet by over 10% in a matter of minutes, with many other cryptocurrencies experiencing even more severe losses.

- **China is surpassing the U.S.** in producing powerful and popular open-source AI tools. So says the Washington Post's Kevin Schaul, based on [an analysis ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/13/china-us-open-source-ai/)<!-- Article curated and by Gemini --> of trends on LMArena, a site that uses blind tests to discover which AI outputs users prefer.

- **PayPal's stablecoin partner Paxos** mistakenly issued 300 trillion (with a "t") of the dollar-pegged token PYUSD Wednesday. The incident had limited impact on crypto markets as Paxos quickly "burned" the excess tokens, erasing them from its blockchain network. But that didn't stop widespread speculation about how such a "fat-finger" mistake could be made in the first place. As part of its normal operations, it seems Paxos had originally intended to mint 300 million (with an "m") PYUSD tokens. Yikes.

### Looking Ahead

- **Non-USD stablecoins are gaining momentum.** Three major Japanese banks are planning to jointly issue a new stablecoin [pegged to the yen](https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-mega-banks-stablecoin-mitsubishi-progmat)<!-- Story curated by ChatGPT, but found a better, non-paywalled link to it on my own -->... Separately, adoption of euro-pegged stablecoins has increased exponentially this year following Europe's implementation of a new regulatory framework for cryptoassets, according to a [new report from Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/europe-crypto-adoption-2025/). <!-- Link curated by Gemini -->

- **BTQ Technologies said** it has successfully demonstrated a new quantum-safe method for verifying Bitcoin transactions.

### Odds & Ends

- **Beyond Meat's sales and stock-market valuation have collapsed.** The plant-based food company's stock closed below [65 cents a share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/) on Friday, compared to an all-time high of $235.
