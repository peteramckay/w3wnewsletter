<!-- Riff on need to take a nuanced view of AI -->

- **A new study published in the *Harvard Business Review* exposed a growing phenomenon called "workslop,"** which is defined as AI-generated content that lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a task. The report found that over 40% of US employees receive such content, leading researchers to conclude that rushed AI deployment without proper training is "destroying productivity."

- The Wikimedia Foundation has reported an 8% decline in human traffic to Wikipedia between May and August 2025, citing the rise of search engines and chatbots providing direct access to Wikipedia content without sending users to the site. This trend, attributed to the growing use of generative AI and social media, has significant implications for the future of online publishing and the sustainability of content creation.

  OpenAI has temporarily suspended generation of videos featuring the civil-rights leader on its “Sora 2” video-creation tool after outrage from the King Estate and others over “disrespectful” user-generated deepfakes.

- **Experts warn that the growing use of AI in clinical settings could create an intractable "blame game" for medical failings.** The introduction of AI-powered tools for diagnosis and care raises complex legal issues, as patients may face significant barriers in demonstrating fault due to a lack of transparency into the AI's internal workings and a challenge in proposing a reasonable alternative design. The report, which came out of a summit hosted by the *Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)*, highlights the need for dedicated funding to properly assess AI tool performance in real-world clinical use.

- **The deployment of "agentic AI" is accelerating, with robots and automated systems now operating completely autonomously in major enterprises.** Companies like Amazon are integrating over 1,000 AI-based services, and an AI agent for a major financial services firm reportedly increased claims won by 13% with "no human in the loop". This shift, which also includes countries like Albania giving an AI a seat at the cabinet table, has raised the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) estimate of jobs "highly exposed to AI" to 40% globally and 60% in industrialized nations.

([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/344818/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-bleed-traders-weigh-end-4-year-cycle)) <!-- Article curated by me, summarized by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | A recent surge in volatility in the cryptocurrency market was triggered by a potential 100% tariff on Chinese imports, leading to approximately $18 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. This event, combined with uncertainty around US-China trade policy, highlights the growing risks and volatility associated with digital assets. ([Lowenstein Crypto](https://www.lowenstein.com/news-insights/newsletters/crypto-brief-october-16-2025)) <!-- Article curated by me, summarized by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | A dramatic crypto flash crash on October 10, 2025, saw Bitcoin plummet by over 10% in a matter of minutes, with many other cryptocurrencies experiencing even more severe losses.

### Looking Ahead

- **A successful demonstration of a quantum-resistant Bitcoin implementation has highlighted the urgent need to address post-quantum threats to the $2+ trillion market.** BTQ Technologies announced the first use of NIST-approved ML-DSA cryptography to replace Bitcoin’s vulnerable signature scheme, completing the full transaction lifecycle from wallet creation to mining. The news emphasizes the "harvest now, decrypt later" risk, where adversaries are already stockpiling data to decrypt later with a functional quantum computer, threatening millions of existing bitcoins with exposed public keys.
