- **Markets:** <!-- Big selloff underway coming into the week. Some even calling it a "crash." Check for updates as needed Friday. --> ([]()) **Bitcoin's price experienced extreme volatility,** with a record single-day liquidation event briefly sending it below the $110,000 mark. Despite the market shock, institutional demand remains robust, with BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) approaching $100 billion in assets under management, underscoring the duality of growing mainstream investment and continued market fragility. ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/here-s-what-investors-need-to-know-about-this-weekend-s-massive-crypto-rout-11829385) / [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/en/market-updates/whats-next-for-btc-price-past-120k), Oct. 14-15, 2025) <!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini --> | **The altcoin market is grappling with a multi-billion dollar "token unlock" deluge,** which is injecting "unprecedented liquidity and potential volatility" into the ecosystem. This period of market risk is highlighted by several massive releases, including those for Aptos, Aethir, and Bittensor, which combined represent a significant portion of the total supply for these tokens.

- **China has begun to pull ahead of the U.S. in the race to create the most powerful open-source AI models.** A Washington Post analysis of publicly available data found that the best open-weight models (freely available and buildable-upon software) are now primarily developed by Chinese firms, such as Alibaba and DeepSeek, displacing American rivals like Meta’s Llama series on key performance leaderboards. The trend is raising geopolitical concerns about which national values will be embedded in the foundational technology of the next internet generation.

The news emphasizes the "harvest now, decrypt later" risk, where adversaries are already stockpiling data to decrypt later with a functional quantum computer, threatening millions of existing bitcoins with exposed public keys.

The change has also catalyzed increased engagement from traditional financial institutions, solidifying Europe's position as a mature, accelerating crypto market.

- **Renewed U.S.-China trade tensions triggered a historic leverage flush, wiping an estimated $19 billion off the crypto derivatives market.** Following a massive rally that pushed Bitcoin's price above $126,000, President Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese tech imports caused a sharp market reversal. The resulting $19 billion liquidation wave across derivatives markets drove Bitcoin back toward the $110,000 range, with analysts describing the event as a market “reset” following overextension.

### Looking Ahead

- **UK regulator proposes regime to allow tokenisation of investment funds** — The UK’s FCA has unveiled a plan to permit tokenised funds (including a “direct to fund” model) using public blockchains, aiming to modernize settlement, reduce friction, and improve accessibility. ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/b26f13bd-516f-40f8-b995-332e933fc9b9?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) <!-- Article curated and summarized by ChatGPT -->

- **The deployment of "agentic AI" is accelerating, with robots and automated systems now operating completely autonomously in major enterprises.** Companies like Amazon are integrating over 1,000 AI-based services, and an AI agent for a major financial services firm reportedly increased claims won by 13% with "no human in the loop". This shift, which also includes countries like Albania giving an AI a seat at the cabinet table, has raised the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) estimate of jobs "highly exposed to AI" to 40% globally and 60% in industrialized nations. ([Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/winners-and-losers-of-the-ai-revolution-artificial-intelligence-is-radically-changing-the-employment-landscape-a-77b505e4-401b-448b-8593-b5fbef4054f2)) <!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini -->

- **Experts warn that the growing use of AI in clinical settings could create an intractable "blame game" for medical failings.** The introduction of AI-powered tools for diagnosis and care raises complex legal issues, as patients may face significant barriers in demonstrating fault due to a lack of transparency into the AI's internal workings and a challenge in proposing a reasonable alternative design. The report, which came out of a summit hosted by the *Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)*, highlights the need for dedicated funding to properly assess AI tool performance in real-world clinical use.
