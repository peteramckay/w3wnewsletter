**American AI companies' scramble for access** to scarce chips and power is heating up:

- **OpenAI partnered with Broadcom** to build its first custom processor for AI use cases. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-taps-broadcom-build-its-first-ai-processor-latest-chip-deal-2025-10-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) <!-- Article surfaced and summarized by ChatGPT-->

- **Google's parent Alphabet announced** a new $24 billion round of investment in AI infrastructure, most of it in India. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-plans-to-invest-9-billion-to-expand-ai-infrastructure-b0a88e0f?st=U4u4sT&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)) <!-- Story surfaced by ChatGPT. But subbed in WSJ gift link I found myself for the more paywalled one suggested by the bot. -->

- **Meta struck a pair of AI-related deals.** Along with Blue Owl, it [raised $30 billion](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/telcos-media-tech/meta-blue-owl-seal-us30-billion-private-capital-deal-ai)<!-- Article surfaced and summarized by Gemini --> to build a new data center in Louisiana. The social giant also [tapped Arm Holdings](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/meta-taps-arm-holdings-power-ai-recommendations-across-facebook-instagram-2025-10-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)<!-- Link surfaced and summarized by ChatGPT.--> to supply chips to handle AI recommendations across Facebook and Instagram. The deal includes a $1.5 billion investment to build a new AI data center in Texas.

- **Analysts say America should be adding** about 80 gigawatts of new power generation capacity a year to keep pace with the growth of AI and other tech applications. But it’s currently building less than 65 gigawatts a year. As a result, AI data centers are increasingly building on-site generation as a workaround to the existing U.S. power grid. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/ai-data-centers-desperate-for-electricity-are-building-their-own-power-plants-291f5c81?st=iCbEVn&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)<!-- Link surfaced by me-->)

- **Salesforce announced it will invest $15 billion** over five years to build a hub on its San Francisco campus to incubate adoption of AI. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/salesforce-invest-15-billion-san-francisco-over-five-years-2025-10-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) <!-- Article surfaced and summarized by ChatGPT -->

**To me, these sort of headlines** echo something Ken Auletta described in [Googled](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/302509/googled-by-ken-auletta/9780143118046), his excellent book about the search giant's early history.

Auletta recounts that founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin would often distinguish between "electron problems" and "atom problems" their company might face. Back in the aughts, those terms were a useful shorthand for things that could be fixed in software versus things related to computer hardware or other limitations of the physical world.

We should remember that same framework very much applies to AI now. And if you want to know where the broader AI boom's limitations might ultimately lie, perhaps start with the "atom problems."

### Week in Review: Oct. 12-18, 2025

- **China is surpassing the U.S.** in producing powerful and popular open-source AI tools. So says the Washington Post's Kevin Schaul, based on [an analysis ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/13/china-us-open-source-ai/)<!-- Article surfaced by Gemini --> of trends on LMArena, a site that uses blind tests to discover which AI outputs users prefer.

- **California enacted new AI rules** requiring companies to disclose when users are interacting with companion chatbots. The law also includes requirements to report mental health risks starting in 2026. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/798875/california-just-passed-a-new-law-requiring-ai-to-tell-you-its-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) <!-- Article surfaced and summarized by ChatGPT -->

- **Tempo, an on-chain payments platform** backed by Stripe and Paradigm, raised a new $500 million venture investment round valuing the company at $5 billion overall. The deal is one of the biggest in the blockchain space in the last few years. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/17/stripe-paradigm-tempo-series-a-5-billion-thrive-capital-greenoaks-joshua-kushner/)) <!-- Article surfaced and summarized by me -->

- **Decrypt's André Beganski reports** that recent volatility in crypto prices has [sparked debate](https://decrypt.co/344887/circuit-breakers-defi-why-managing-chaos-on-chain-isnt-easy) in the industry about whether decentralized finance platforms (DeFi) should implement market circuit breakers like the stock market to prevent runaway panics. Skeptics say such a system might be implausible to create on-chain versus on conventional stock exchanges. <!-- Article surfaced by me -->  

- **PayPal's stablecoin partner Paxos** mistakenly issued 300 trillion (with a "t") of the dollar-pegged token PYUSD Wednesday. The incident had limited impact on crypto markets as Paxos quickly "burned" the excess tokens, erasing them from its blockchain network. But that didn't stop widespread speculation about how such a "fat-finger" mistake could be made in the first place. As part of its normal operations, it seems Paxos had originally intended to mint 300 million (with an "m") PYUSD tokens. Yikes.

### Looking Ahead

- **Non-USD stablecoins are gaining momentum.** Three major Japanese banks are planning to jointly issue a new stablecoin [pegged to the yen](https://cointelegraph.com/news/japan-mega-banks-stablecoin-mitsubishi-progmat)<!-- Story surfaced by ChatGPT, but found a better, non-paywalled link to it on my own -->... Separately, adoption of euro-pegged stablecoins has increased exponentially this year following Europe's implementation of a new regulatory framework for cryptoassets, according to a [new report from Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/europe-crypto-adoption-2025/). <!-- Link surfaced by Gemini -->

- **BTQ Technologies said** it has successfully demonstrated a new quantum-safe method for verifying Bitcoin transactions. If their solution scales as hoped from here, it could solve a major security issue facing Bitcoin from the emergence of powerful next-generation computers.

- **MarketWatch's Jurica Dujmovic** just wrote a [normie-friendly explainer](https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)<!-- Story surfaced by ChatGPT, but found a better link to it on my own than the one suggested by the bot --> of tokenization, which he notes is now being applied to everything from real estate to U.S. Treasurys... Meanwhile, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority proposed rules that would enable asset managers to [tokenize shares](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/uk-regulator-backs-tokenised-funds-attract-younger-investors-2025-10-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)<!-- surfaced by ChatGPT --> in their investment funds on public blockchains like Ethereum, with an eye toward attracting younger investors.

### Odds & Ends

- **Beyond Meat's sales and stock-market valuation have collapsed.** The plant-based food company's stock closed below [65 cents a share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/) on Friday, compared to an all-time high of $235. Since the pandemic in particular, [Beyond has been beset](https://news.google.com/read/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNdTFvbmd3U1NaazhHZXFHSHp2dDU1M0Z0X0JFT1R1MVUxNWVtY3pENG9PdTBlWkZxejVZbmpuWV9UNDlST3h4Q3dNTktWNC1aOEQxUzhST3pmODdRM1lPS3VtU0lHUGt2RXFaWXRoRzkzRXlGQzFxdThya0tBdjVXTmFEaUFsTFBycWFKZWNqQ3J0MDdBVEVmc3VURldmc3BJbE8yS3ZMV2M1UVhsaTZXTV9pZ0RZYktDMjJneg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)<!-- surfaced this one myself --> by increased competition from Impossible Foods and a shift in consumer tastes toward animal protein. If Beyond's share price remains below $1 much longer, Nasdaq may even [de-list the company](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/14/beyond-meat-plantbased-debt-investors-shares/99c9abd8-a936-11f0-a2bc-82cf6840599d_story.html)<!-- surfaced this one myself -->. Ouch.

- **Bodycam footage of police** chasing a rogue inflatable jack-o-lantern in suburban Cleveland [went viral](https://www.salon.com/2025/10/12/the-great-pumpkin-is-real-and-on-the-run-in-ohio/)<!-- Found this one myself -->.
