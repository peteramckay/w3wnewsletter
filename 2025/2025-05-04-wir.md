Adding a couple of news items to "Five Things" section below, drafted by Leo/Llama 3.1 based on the following prompt...

I'm thinking of using the news article in this browser tab in my upcoming newsletter, which contains a bulleted list summarizing important tech news each week. Could you please summarize this story in a paragraph of 1-2 sentences, written in a style that I could use for my newsletter? Please format your response as markdown, with the article hyperlink embedded somewhere in the text. No need for a headline.

### Five Things: April 27 to May 3, 2025

*The week's top headlines about blockchain, AI, and other emerging technologies and trends re-shaping the web:*

- Apple has revised its App Store guidelines to allow developers to include links to external payment methods, potentially paving the way for a new wave of crypto and NFT-related apps on the U.S. App Store. This change comes after a court ruling in favor of Epic Games, which had sued Apple over its commission fees on in-app purchases. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/353047/u-s-app-store-to-allow-apps-to-skirt-30-fee-on-nft-crypto-sales-following-apples-legal-defeat))

- AdTech firm Thumzup Media Corporation is seeking to raise $200 million to bolster its bitcoin treasury, which currently holds around $1.8 million worth of bitcoin. This move is part of a growing trend of companies mirroring similar strategy-inspired plays, with Thumzup's market cap of around $48.5 million, as reported in a recent SEC filing, making it a notable example in the crypto space. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/353043/adtech-firm-thumzup-seeks-200-million-to-100x-size-of-bitcoin-treasury))

### Looking Ahead


- De-dollarization? <!-- Recent JPM remark on it being more plausible post-tariffs. Coinbase analysts warn of a potential "crypto winter" due to the ongoing trade war and decreased investor confidence. Bitcoin's price is currently above its 200-day moving average, but has shown volatility in recent weeks.

### Odds & Ends

- **"All is well with Journalism."** So declared the trainer of a three-year-old racehorse named Journalism in an interview [with the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/sports/journalism-kentucky-derby-horse-racing-1b7c6b02?st=2ShcYJ&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) prior to Saturday's running of the Kentucky Derby. Journalism even went off as a 7-2 favorite to win the prestigious event. But then he [finished second](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25192701-sovereignty-wins-2025-kentucky-derby-pulls-upset-favorite-journalism) to Sovereignty.

- **Happy Star Wars Day!** In my opinion, the [new season of Andor](https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/andor-season-2-review-disney-star-wars-1236372979/) on Disney+ is well worth a watch this "May the 4th." Will have to update my previously published [recommended viewing order](https://peteramckay.medium.com/the-fastest-hunk-o-junk-in-the-galaxy-58cb09646481) for live-action Star Wars content to include it soon... Meanwhile, if you're still looking for offline events to commemorate the holiday, the Associated Press reports celebrations will be especially lit [in New Hope, Pennsylvania](https://apnews.com/article/star-wars-day-may-4th-holiday-ea1b5b43b00c23f53294dc159da2bae9) this year.
