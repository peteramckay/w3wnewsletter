**The idea that institutions should hold bitcoin** to diversify their cash reserves is still very much alive and well. But there do seem to be some distinctions lately depending on *which* sort of institution is in play.

In the public sector,
<!-- *Mixed news on institutional BTC treasuries:* The CoinDesk article titled "Arizona Governor Calls Crypto an â€˜Untested Investment,â€™ Striking Bitcoin Reserve Bill" reports that *Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill* (Senate Bill 1025) that would have permitted the state to hold Bitcoin as part of its official reserves using seized funds. The governor referred to crypto as an "untested investment".  -->

In academia,
<!-- The Decrypt article titled "Brown University Bets on Bitcoin With Millions Worth of BlackRock ETF Shares" reports that *Brown University* has disclosed holding exposure to Bitcoin through its investment in *BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT)*. As of March 31, the university held 105,000 shares, valued at nearly $5 million. -->

Then there's the corporate world, TKTKTK

<!-- |  | AdTech firm Thumzup Media Corporation is seeking to raise $200 million to bolster its bitcoin treasury, which currently holds around $1.8 million worth of bitcoin. This move is part of a growing trend of companies mirroring similar strategy-inspired plays, with Thumzup's market cap of around $48.5 million, as reported in a recent SEC filing, making it a notable example in the crypto space. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/353043/adtech-firm-thumzup-seeks-200-million-to-100x-size-of-bitcoin-treasury)) | The Decrypt article titled "Public Keys: Strategy Doubles Down on Bitcoin Plans, Robinhood Glitters With Gold" covers public crypto companies, detailing Strategy's "42-42 Capital Plan" focusing on Bitcoin despite a recent quarterly loss. -->

### Five Things: April 27 to May 3, 2025

*The week's top headlines emerging technologies and trends re-shaping the web:*

- **Apple took its turn in America's antitrust crosshairs.** A federal judge in Oakland ruled that Apple [violated an earlier court order](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-judge-rules-apple-violated-order-reform-app-store-2025-04-30/) to reform its App Store to allow greater competition in download options and payment methods on mobile devices. She referred the case to federal prosecutors, who may now pursue criminal charges in the matter. Apple said it plans to appeal the decision. But in the meantime, it immediately relaxed some payment rules in its U.S. App Store. The changes could prove particularly [helpful to web3 apps](https://www.theblock.co/post/353047/u-s-app-store-to-allow-apps-to-skirt-30-fee-on-nft-crypto-sales-following-apples-legal-defeat), which have sometimes struggled to offer cost-effective trading in non-fungible tokens and digital currencies on Apple devices.

- **New AI product launches by Big Tech:** Amazon began [rolling out Alexa+](https://decrypt.co/317605/amazon-rolling-out-enhanced-alexa), its new AI-powered assistant, to more than 100,000 early users in a limited preview, months after the company originally scheduled the release for last October. Meanwhile, Meta [launched a standalone app](https://decrypt.co/316997/metas-latest-standalone-ai-app) for its Meta AI assistant. The new offering seeks to expand Meta's reach in the AI sector beyond users of its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms.

- **OpenAI rolled back an update to ChatGPT** meant to improve the bot's personality. Instead, the company faced a swift backlash on social media among users complaining the popular AI app had become overly sycophantic, to the point of seeming disingenuous and manipulative. Ouch. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/317055/openai-chatgpt-update-users-revolt-over-sycophantic-behavior))

- **In the U.S. Senate, some unexpected twists regarding crypto:** Republicans Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska [publicly criticized](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/02/senate-republicans-raise-red-flags-about-trumps-private-dinner-with-his-meme-coin-holders.html) Donald Trump's recent private dinner with large holders of his TRUMP memecoin. Meanwhile, on Democrats' side of the aisle, nine members [pulled their earlier support](https://cointelegraph.com/news/democrats-pull-support-gop-stablecoin-bill) for a pending stablecoin bill, jeopardizing the proposal's chance of passage in its current form. The situation also underscores how difficult it is on Capitol Hill these days to pass *any* legislation whatsoever regarding tech. Politco's Mohar Chatterjee [explored that broader trend](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2025/04/29/a-tech-law-just-passed-could-it-happen-again-00316428) in painful detail Thursday.

- **A new study sparked fresh debate about AI ethics in the academy.** Researchers at the University of Zurich sparked outrage after secretly deploying AI bots on Reddit that pretended to be rape survivors, trauma counselors, and even a "Black man opposed to Black Lives Matter" â€” all to see if they could change people's minds on controversial topics. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/316976/secret-reddit-experiment-using-ai-personas-sparks-ethics-scandal-in-academia))

### Looking Ahead

- **Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley** plan to add spot crypto trading for their U.S. retail customers, including users of Morgan's E*Trade platform. Such a move by the brokerage giants will greatly expand small investors' ability to trade tokens alongside stocks and other conventional assets. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/05/02/morgan-stanley-charles-schwab-corp-to-offer-crypto-trading/?in_brief=true))

- **The European Union is set to impose** sweeping anti-money laundering rules that will ban privacy-preserving tokens and anonymous cryptocurrency accounts beginning in 2027. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-crypto-ban-anonymous-privacy-tokens-2027))

### Odds & Ends

- **"All is well with Journalism."** So declared the trainer of a three-year-old racehorse named Journalism in an interview [with the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/sports/journalism-kentucky-derby-horse-racing-1b7c6b02?st=2ShcYJ&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) prior to Saturday's running of the Kentucky Derby. Journalism even went off as a 7-2 favorite to win the prestigious event. But then he [finished second](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25192701-sovereignty-wins-2025-kentucky-derby-pulls-upset-favorite-journalism) to Sovereignty.

- **Happy Star Wars Day!** In my opinion, the [new season of Andor](https://variety.com/2025/tv/reviews/andor-season-2-review-disney-star-wars-1236372979/) on Disney+ is well worth a watch this "May the 4th." Will have to update my previously published [recommended viewing order](https://peteramckay.medium.com/the-fastest-hunk-o-junk-in-the-galaxy-58cb09646481) for live-action Star Wars content to include it soon... Meanwhile, if you're still looking for offline events to commemorate the holiday, the Associated Press reports celebrations will be especially lit [in New Hope, Pennsylvania](https://apnews.com/article/star-wars-day-may-4th-holiday-ea1b5b43b00c23f53294dc159da2bae9) this year.
