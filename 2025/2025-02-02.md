**A quick self-assessment test** for everyone in the U.S. tech industry:

- Are you three feet tall?
- Is your skin green?
- Are your ears pointy?

If you answered "no" to all three of these questions, I'm sorry to report that you are not Yoda. This means you cannot in fact see the future.

This outcome should not be surprising, of course, as Yoda is fictional. But even if he did

My initial impression of the DeepSeek news is that it underscores two important points.

1) It underscores open source.

2) It underscores the reality of a hype cycle. Witness Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's [dubious claim](https://gizmodo.com/anthropic-ceo-hilariously-claims-ai-will-double-human-lifespans-within-a-decade-2000554601) Thursday that AI will figure out how to double the average human lifespan within 10 years.

3) It underscores the problem of oligarchy: It's less innovative.
