# Tether is now almost as profitable as Goldman Sachs.
## Can we stop predicting the stablecoin issuer's supposedly imminent collapse yet?

**You will never hear me deny that crypto bulls** sometimes make cartoonishly triumphant claims and predictions. These are easy to spot (and mock) whenever bitcoin [doesn't zoom to $1 million per token](https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-coinbase-cto-makes-2m-bet-on-bitcoin-s-performance) within a 90-day timeframe, for example.

That said, some bears' crypto doomsaying strikes me as equally outlandish at this point. But bears tend to get away with their whoppers more readily because, frankly, the mainstream press is more sympathetic to them.

Start with the gross overgeneralization that crypto is *all* a fraud, not a marketplace that sometimes has individual bad actors who are exceptions to the norm, as happens in stocks or real estate or any other asset.

Truly, wherever you find people and money, you will find people trying to screw other people out of money. Unfortunately, this is a feature of human beings, not something unique to crypto or any other investment.

Overestimating the preventive power of agency regulation and underestimating the importance of market-based validation.

Some other string...

At some point, critics' assertions that crypto is all going to vanish have to be considered as delusional as anything the bulls make.

Zeke Fawkes and Batman actors books dedicated long passages to predicting Tether's doom.

My initial impression of the DeepSeek news is that it underscores two important points.

1) It underscores open source.

2) It underscores the reality of a hype cycle. Witness Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's [dubious claim](https://gizmodo.com/anthropic-ceo-hilariously-claims-ai-will-double-human-lifespans-within-a-decade-2000554601) Thursday that AI will figure out how to double the average human lifespan within 10 years.

3) It underscores the problem of oligarchy: It's less innovative.

- **Crypto prices were held in check** by a mixed outlook for U.S. inflation and [interest rates](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/28/fed-holds-rates-steady-takes-note-of-elevated-inflation). Perhaps most concerning, the Trump administration began [implementing tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-says-tariffs-are-coming-on-computer-chips-steel-and-more-cef9974c?st=Q7Uc7p&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) against three of America's largest international trading partners, with additional industry-specific levies promised to come. An escalating trade war could put upward pressure on U.S. consumer prices in the months ahead as importers pass along the cost of tariffs. That in turn would effectively discourage interest-rate cuts friendly to traders of crypto, stocks, and other assets.

- **As of Saturday afternoon in New York,** the global token market's valuation stood at $3.5 trillion, down more than 3% for the week. Bitcoin and ether each suffered similar 7-day declines in percentage terms. Meanwhile, Solana was a notable market laggard, off 13% for the week, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/).
