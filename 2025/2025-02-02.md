**People in America's tech industry** are usually proud to ["live in the future,"](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/metas-2023-progress-in-ai-and-mixed-reality/) meaning a relentless daily focus on emerging tools and trends. But some nasty surprises just jolted everyone back to present tense in the starkest way possible, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value along the way:

- **China-based startup DeepSeek launched a new AI app for U.S. users** that answers queries using far less processing power and electricity than popular U.S.-made AIs like ChatGPT. The move upended longstanding assumptions about America's leadership in AI, the likely returns on billions that have already been invested in the sector around Silicon Valley, and the technical requirements for scaling new AI applications.

- **U.S. tech shares plunged**

- **Crypto prices were held in check** by a mixed outlook for U.S. inflation and [interest rates](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/28/fed-holds-rates-steady-takes-note-of-elevated-inflation). Perhaps most concerning, the Trump administration began [implementing tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-says-tariffs-are-coming-on-computer-chips-steel-and-more-cef9974c?st=Q7Uc7p&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) against three of America's largest international trading partners, with additional industry-specific levies promised to come. An escalating trade war could put upward pressure on U.S. consumer prices in the months ahead as importers pass along the cost of tariffs. That in turn would effectively discourage interest-rate cuts friendly to traders of crypto, stocks, and other assets.

- **As of Saturday afternoon in New York,** the global token market's valuation stood at $3.5 trillion, down more than 3% for the week. Bitcoin and ether each suffered similar 7-day declines in percentage terms. Meanwhile, Solana was a notable market laggard, off 13% for the week, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). <!-- Need updates -->
