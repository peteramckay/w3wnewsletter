**People in America's tech industry** are usually proud to ["live in the future,"](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/metas-2023-progress-in-ai-and-mixed-reality/) meaning a relentless daily focus on emerging tools and trends. But some nasty surprises just jolted everyone back to present tense in the starkest way possible, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value along the way:

- **China-based startup DeepSeek launched a new AI app for U.S. users** that answers queries using far less processing power and electricity than popular U.S.-made AIs like ChatGPT. The move upended longstanding assumptions about America's leadership in AI, the technical requirements for scaling new AI applications, and the likely returns on billions that have already been invested in the sector around Silicon Valley. ([Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/markets/quick-and-dirty-timeline-of-markets-deepseek-freak/))

- **U.S. tech tocks plunged,** including a slide in Nvidia shares Monday that slashed the chipmaker's valuation by [nearly $600 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html). In dollar terms, that was the biggest one-day decline for a single company in U.S. history, reflecting concerns that Nvidia will lose its dominance in the market making components for AI computers. The Nasdaq Composite Index, a broader measure tied heavily to tech stocks, [fell 1.6%](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/business/money-report/sp-500-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-parse-apple-earnings-await-inflation-data-live-updates/3831300/) for the week. 

- **A story that holds up really well now:** On Jan. 20, Kolawole Samuel Adebayo of Forbes published [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kolawolesamueladebayo/2025/01/20/experts-predict-the-bubble-may-burst-for-ai-in-2025/) based on interviews with experts at OxyLabs about risk factors that could burst the AI bubble this year.

- **Stocks and crypto prices were also hurt** by a mixed outlook for U.S. inflation and [interest rates](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/28/fed-holds-rates-steady-takes-note-of-elevated-inflation). Perhaps most concerning, the Trump administration began [implementing tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-says-tariffs-are-coming-on-computer-chips-steel-and-more-cef9974c?st=Q7Uc7p&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) against three of America's largest international trading partners, with additional industry-specific levies promised to come. An escalating trade war could put upward pressure on U.S. consumer prices in the months ahead as importers pass along the cost of tariffs. That in turn would effectively discourage interest-rate cuts friendly to traders of crypto, stocks, and other assets.

- **As of Sunday evening in New York,** the global token market's valuation stood at $3.25 trillion, down nearly 10% for the week. Bitcoin slid 7%, ether 11%, and Solana 18%, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/). 

### Week in Review: Jan. 26 to Feb. 2, 2025

The week's notable developments elsewhere:

- **Stablecoin issuer Tether reported** an annual profit of [$13 billion for 2024](https://www.theblock.co/post/338275/tether-reports-13-billion-in-yearly-net-profits-for-2024). That's more than double its net income in 2023 and [nearly on par](https://decrypt.co/303882/tether-record-shattering-profits-bitcoin-usdt) with Goldman Sachs' 2024 profit of $14.3 billion. Tether has become by far the dominant player in stablecoins, with nearly 70% share of a market that has [grown to over $200 billion](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/31/stablecoin-market-surges-past-usd200b-signaling-potential-crypto-price-upswing) in global valuation.

- **Tech consulting firm MicroStrategy raised $563.4 million** through a new offering of preferred shares. It plans to use a portion of the cash to buy more bitcoin for its corporate treasury. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/31/microstrategy-upsizes-preferred-stock-offering-raising-usd563m-for-more-bitcoin))

- **Grayscale has filed proposals with U.S. regulators** to convert some of its listed trusts into exchange-traded funds for [Ripple](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/31/grayscale-files-sec-proposal-to-convert-xrp-trust-into-etf) and [Dogecoin](https://decrypt.co/303843/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-issuer-grayscale-debuts-a-new-dogecoin-trust).

- **Coinbase acquired** the decentralized advertising platform Spindl for an undisclosed sum. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/338276/coinbase-acquires-web3-adtech-platform-spindl))

### Odds & Ends

- **Researchers from Japan's Kyushu University have discovered** the building blocks for organic matter, including carbon, nitrogen and ammonia, in rock samples from the asteroid Bennu.
