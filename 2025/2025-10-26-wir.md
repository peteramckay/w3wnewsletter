- **Major Study Finds AI Chatbots Misrepresent News Content Nearly Half the Time** A new study by 22 international public service media organizations, including the BBC and NPR, found that AI assistants like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Google's Gemini systematically distort news content in 45% of responses. The research found significant sourcing problems and factual errors, raising major alarms over AI's role in information integrity as public reliance on these tools for news consumption grows.

### Looking Ahead

- **Some eye-popping stats on AI investment:** Hedge funds' holdings in chipmaker shares and other AI-related hardware hit [a nine-year high](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/hedge-flow-hedge-funds-boost-ai-tech-bets-highest-since-2016-goldman-sachs-says-2025-10-24/)<!-- Curated by ChatGPT. --> in October, according to new data from Goldman Sachs...

The outlays so far have already been so significant that they've helped drive the broad-based S&P 500 higher this year... But that also means the U.S. stock market is [increasingly vulnerable](https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/ai-bubble-cisco-moment-dotcom-crash-nvidia-jensen-huang-top-analyst/)<!-- Curated by me--> to a painful pullback if and when corporate AI spending inevitably slows.

- **The Journal of the American Medical Association** just published a new study about the effects of social media on children's cognition. The paper is somewhat unusual in its focus on social, not children's screen time in general. Its findings suggest that measures by parents and social-media companies to limit children's exposure to social apps could improve cognitive function, including reading scores.
