**There is a simple answer** to one of the most burning questions about AI right now: Is it undergoing a massive bubble, or is it truly a world-changing innovation?

Yes.

We need a more balanced view that comprises both the potential and the limitations of the technology.

Some leftover headlines from the last week or two about AI's downsides below...

-->

- **A new study published in the Harvard Business Review exposed a growing phenomenon called "workslop,"** which is defined as AI-generated content that lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a task. The report found that over 40% of US employees receive such content, leading researchers to conclude that rushed AI deployment without proper training is "destroying productivity." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/ai-workslop-us-employees), Oct. 12, 2025) <!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini |  The Wikimedia Foundation has reported an 8% decline in human traffic to Wikipedia between May and August 2025, citing the rise of search engines and chatbots providing direct access to Wikipedia content without sending users to the site. This trend, attributed to the growing use of generative AI and social media, has significant implications for the future of online publishing and the sustainability of content creation. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/344845/wikipedia-traffic-drops-ai-answers-eat-free-encyclopedia)) <!-- Article curated by me, summarized by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B | **OpenAI pauses deepfakes of Martin Luther King Jr. on its video tool** [https://www.theverge.com/news/801539/open-ai-sora-mlk](https://www.theverge.com/news/801539/open-ai-sora-mlk) OpenAI has temporarily suspended generation of videos featuring the civil-rights leader on its “Sora 2” video-creation tool after outrage from the King Estate and others over “disrespectful” user-generated deepfakes. The company now says it will let estates and authorised representatives opt-out of their likenesses being used. ([The Verge][1]) <!-- Link surfaced and summarized by ChagGPT. -->

- A recent EY survey found that more than half of large firms have incurred losses from early AI rollouts. https://www.reuters.com/business/most-companies-suffer-some-risk-related-financial-loss-deploying-ai-ey-survey-2025-10-08/ <!-- Link surfaced and summarized by ChagGPT.

- **Experts warn that the growing use of AI in clinical settings could create an intractable "blame game" for medical failings.** The introduction of AI-powered tools for diagnosis and care raises complex legal issues, as patients may face significant barriers in demonstrating fault due to a lack of transparency into the AI's internal workings and a challenge in proposing a reasonable alternative design. The report, which came out of a summit hosted by the *Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)*, highlights the need for dedicated funding to properly assess AI tool performance in real-world clinical use.

- **The deployment of "agentic AI" is accelerating, with robots and automated systems now operating completely autonomously in major enterprises.** Companies like Amazon are integrating over 1,000 AI-based services, and an AI agent for a major financial services firm reportedly increased claims won by 13% with "no human in the loop". This shift, which also includes countries like Albania giving an AI a seat at the cabinet table, has raised the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) estimate of jobs "highly exposed to AI" to 40% globally and 60% in industrialized nations.

- **Oracle Stock Drops Amid Investor Concerns Over OpenAI Revenue Reliance** Shares of Oracle sank after its quarterly update, despite projecting robust sales growth, as some Wall Street analysts expressed concerns about the company's reliance on revenue from OpenAI and other major customers for its AI infrastructure buildout. The company is collaborating with OpenAI and SoftBank on the "Stargate" AI infrastructure project, and the market reaction highlights volatility surrounding the concentrated nature of generative AI spending.
