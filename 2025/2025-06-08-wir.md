Riff on WSJ story about crypto's pro-MAGA swing as an anti-libertarian development.

Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B:

Bitcoin's close ties to the Trump administration are causing discomfort among some factions of the crypto world, as the industry seeks to gain mainstream acceptance. The industry's flagship event, the Bitcoin Conference, has become a platform for Trump officials and allies to promote their favored policies, with some critics warning that the government's increasing involvement could create conflicts of interest and jeopardize the industry's legitimacy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/bitcoin-goes-all-in-on-maga-shedding-its-antigovernment-slant-2f1bb3d0?st=p5MmW7&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))  

Wrap in mention of Trump-Musk blowup as well. CNBC coverage of the melodrama: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/05/trump-musk-crazy-government-contracts.html

Luckily, Kanye is trying to [mediate the whole thing](https://www.salon.com/2025/06/05/please-noooooo-ye-implores-trump-musk-to-reconcile/), it seems. That should help.

The 10-year anniversary of Trump's entry into presidential politics is approaching on June 16. https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/16/media/trump-announcement-one-year-later/index.html

**Trump Media filed a proposal** with U.S. regulators to offer [an exchange-traded bitcoin fund](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trumps-truth-social-officially-files-for-bitcoin-etf-as-company-deepens-crypto-push-150426350.html). Fees from the listing would add to the U.S. president's personal profits from crypto since taking office -- a trend that has drawn ethics complaints from critics in Congress and beyond. President Trump's haul has already topped $1 billion



company Truth Social is looking to launch a bitcoin ETF. https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/06/04/trumps-truth-social-continues-crypto-push-with-step-toward-bitcoin-etf-launch-cnbc-crypto-world.html | https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trumps-truth-social-officially-files-for-bitcoin-etf-as-company-deepens-crypto-push-150426350.html | He's already made over 1B on crypto: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2025/06/05/this-is-how-much-trump-has-made-from-crypto-so-far/ | https://www.theblock.co/post/357210/world-liberty-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-firms-building-unaffiliated-trump-branded-wallet-report

### Odds & Ends

**Farewell, WTF.** Comedian Marc Maron announced on [Monday's episode](https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-1648-john-mulaney) of his podcast WTF that he and producer Brendan McDonald will end the 16-year project this fall.

In Salon's coverage of the announcement, senior cultural critic Melanie McFarland accurately [captured](https://www.salon.com/2025/06/04/marc-marons-heart-made-wtf-a-hit-in-the-joe-rogan-age-its-all-about-shallow-brawn/) Maron's significance as a pioneer for podcasting. He was undeniably an early adopter of the technology, of course. And in June 2015, he became the first podcaster to [interview a sitting president](https://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_613_-_president_barack_obama), a colossal milestone for the medium itself.  

McFarland also notes how the warmth and humanity Maron has consistently brought to WTF throughout its run have proved to be a sad exception as podcasting has exploded in popularity over the years:

>*Maron’s production output has been daunting since the earliest days of “WTF,” churning out two episodes a week to build an archive surpassing 1,600 installments. (Monday’s episode is No. 1,648.) All these years later, and with a constellation’s worth of additional competition, it’s still one of the most downloaded and streamed podcasts going.*
>
>*But it’s also a small island in a medium overrun by shallow rage theater celebrating thoughtlessness. Within that swirl, “WTF” stands out as an oasis of introspection thanks to Maron presenting his show as an open cavern of feeling, constantly exposing new corners of insight and inviting listeners inside to revel in those discoveries.*

At this point, Maron has well earned a break, which he says he sorely needs from the production grind. But I do hope *someone* keeps making media like WTF on the internet, stuff that's kind and thoughtful and not so "twitchy," to borrow a favorite phrase of my old newspaper colleague Kara Swisher, now a hugely popular podcaster herself.

To the extent we're all content creators on social networks these days, maybe each of us could even take on a small piece of the task from here, everyday, one post at a time.

Boomer lives!
