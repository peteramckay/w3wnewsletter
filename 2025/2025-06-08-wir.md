### Five Things: June 1-7, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

<!-- First two items here are candidates to expand into lead item... -->

- Bitcoin's close ties to the Trump administration are causing discomfort among some factions of the crypto world, as the industry seeks to gain mainstream acceptance. The industry's flagship event, the Bitcoin Conference, has become a platform for Trump officials and allies to promote their favored policies, with some critics warning that the government's increasing involvement could create conflicts of interest and jeopardize the industry's legitimacy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/bitcoin-goes-all-in-on-maga-shedding-its-antigovernment-slant-2f1bb3d0?st=p5MmW7&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))  <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Marc Maron is ending his popular podcast "WTF with Marc Maron" after 16 years, citing burnout and a sense of satisfaction with the show's impact on culture. The podcast, known for its introspective and often emotional conversations with celebrities, has been a staple of the medium and a refuge from the world's anger and confusion. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/06/04/marc-marons-heart-made-wtf-a-hit-in-the-joe-rogan-age-its-all-about-shallow-brawn/)) <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Reddit has filed a lawsuit against AI company Anthropic, alleging that it continued to access and use the online forum's data without permission, despite claiming to have stopped. The complaint claims that Anthropic's actions were unauthorized and violated Reddit's user data policy, and that the company used the data for commercial purposes without paying for it. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/reddit-lawsuit-anthropic-ai-3b9624dd?st=YhJVhU&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)) <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Meta makes investment in nuclear data centers by Contellation. <!-- Link TK -->

- Bloomberg: BlackRock BTC ETF had record inflows in May. <!-- Link TK -->

- Bloomberg: Lummis says Genius Act will pass next week, won't allow interest-bearing stablecoin accounts due to political trade-offs. <!-- Link TK -->

### Looking Ahead

- A data center boom is underway in the desert east of Reno, Nevada, with major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple building massive facilities to support their artificial intelligence and cloud computing needs. This surge in construction has raised concerns about the energy demands and carbon costs of the AI revolution, which is the focus of MIT Technology Review's new series, "Power Hungry."

- Prof G/Pat McGee on iPhone in the U.S. ([]()) <!-- Link TK -->

- **Uh-oh.** ABC News reports that "wrench attacks" against wealthy crypto investors are [on the rise](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/wrench-attacks-wealthy-crypto-holders-rise-122270144). One high-profile example: A recent [kidnapping and torture case](https://nypost.com/2025/05/23/us-news/kentucky-crypto-investor-allegedly-tortured-captive-italian-tourist-for-weeks-in-luxury-nyc-apartment-sources/) in New York's posh SoHo neighborhood. <!-- Draft by PM -->

### Odds & Ends

- Despite the COVID-19 pandemic having a devastating impact on American students and schools in many areas, high school graduation rates have continued to rise steadily over the past five years. However, this trend is concerning as it suggests that many students are being allowed to graduate underprepared for college or the workforce, with research indicating that chronic absenteeism during the pandemic had a significantly weakened effect on graduation rates. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/15/schools-pandemic-graduation-rates/)) <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Airline experts have discovered that some major carriers, including Delta, United, and American Airlines, are charging individual passengers more for seats on identical flights compared to groups of travelers. This pricing strategy, which may not be new, has sparked debate among travel experts and raises questions about transparency in airline pricing.
