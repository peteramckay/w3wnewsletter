Riff on WSJ story about crypto's pro-MAGA swing as an anti-libertarian development.

Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B:

Bitcoin's close ties to the Trump administration are causing discomfort among some factions of the crypto world, as the industry seeks to gain mainstream acceptance. The industry's flagship event, the Bitcoin Conference, has become a platform for Trump officials and allies to promote their favored policies, with some critics warning that the government's increasing involvement could create conflicts of interest and jeopardize the industry's legitimacy. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/bitcoin-goes-all-in-on-maga-shedding-its-antigovernment-slant-2f1bb3d0?st=p5MmW7&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))  

Wrap in mention of Trump-Musk blowup as well. CNBC coverage of the melodrama: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/05/trump-musk-crazy-government-contracts.html

Luckily, Kanye is trying to [mediate the whole thing](https://www.salon.com/2025/06/05/please-noooooo-ye-implores-trump-musk-to-reconcile/), it seems. That should help.

The 10-year anniversary of Trump's entry into presidential politics is approaching on June 16. https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/16/media/trump-announcement-one-year-later/index.html

### Odds & Ends

Marc Maron is ending his popular podcast "WTF with Marc Maron" after 16 years, citing burnout and a sense of satisfaction with the show's impact on culture. The podcast, known for its introspective and often emotional conversations with celebrities, has been a staple of the medium and a refuge from the world's anger and confusion.
