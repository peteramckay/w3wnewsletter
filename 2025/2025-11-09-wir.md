<!--
Digest a bunch o' string from last week...

A new study published in the Harvard Business Review exposed a growing phenomenon called "workslop,"** which is defined as AI-generated content that lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a task. The report found that over 40% of US employees receive such content, leading researchers to conclude that rushed AI deployment without proper training is "destroying productivity." ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/ai-workslop-us-employees), Oct. 12, 2025) <!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini |  The Wikimedia Foundation has reported an 8% decline in human traffic to Wikipedia between May and August 2025, citing the rise of search engines and chatbots providing direct access to Wikipedia content without sending users to the site. This trend, attributed to the growing use of generative AI and social media, has significant implications for the future of online publishing and the sustainability of content creation. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/344845/wikipedia-traffic-drops-ai-answers-eat-free-encyclopedia)) <!-- Article curated by me, summarized by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B | AI assistants make widespread sourcing errors, new research finds [https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ai-assistants-make-widespread-errors-about-news-new-research-shows-2025-10-21/](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ai-assistants-make-widespread-errors-about-news-new-research-shows-2025-10-21/) ([Reuters][4]) *Why it matters*: As AI becomes more embedded in workflows (news, search, assistance) the “trust” and “accuracy” aspects are coming into sharper focus — relevant for enterprise and consumer contexts.

The report, which came out of a summit hosted by the *Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)*, highlights the need for dedicated funding to properly assess AI tool performance in real-world clinical use. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/13/ai-tools-medical-health-liability-artificial-intelligence)) <!-- Article curated and summarized by Gemini | **Cisco Study: Only 13% of Global Enterprises Are ‘AI-Ready’ for Scaled Deployment** The Cisco 2025 AI Readiness Index revealed that while virtually all businesses are experimenting with AI, only 13% are truly prepared to deploy and scale AI solutions with measurable value. The report suggests most companies face significant gaps in critical areas like data quality, security, talent, and governance, indicating that the path from AI pilot to enterprise transformation remains highly challenging. [Link](https://dig.watch/updates/new-cisco-study-shows-most-companies-arent-ai-ready) <!-- Story curated by Google Gemini | **Major Study Finds AI Chatbots Misrepresent News Content Nearly Half the Time** A new study by 22 international public service media organizations, including the BBC and NPR, found that AI assistants like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Google's Gemini systematically distort news content in 45% of responses. The research found significant sourcing problems and factual errors, raising major alarms over AI's role in information integrity as public reliance on these tools for news consumption grows. ([DW](https://www.dw.com/en/ai-chatbots-misrepresent-news-almost-half-the-time-says-major-new-study/a-74392921)) <!-- Story curated by Google Gemini | [“These nonprofits lobbied to regulate OpenAI — then the subpoenas came”](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/801994/openai-subpoenas-intimidation-tactics-nonprofits-elon-musk-restructuring) (The Verge) — ([The Verge][1]) A deep dive into how OpenAI is deploying broad subpoenas against nonprofit organisations critical of its governance and restructuring—which poses serious questions about power, oversight and AI company accountability. <!-- Story curated by ChatGPT -->

- **Microsoft's AI Investments:** Microsoft signed a $\$9.7$ billion cloud services agreement with Australian AI infrastructure provider IREN to secure access to Nvidia chips, aiming to bolster its capacity to meet surging AI demand. This deal, along with a revised agreement with **OpenAI**, briefly pushed Microsoft's valuation to $\$4$ trillion for the second time this year. Furthermore, Microsoft plans to ship over 60,000 Nvidia Blackwell AI chips to the United Arab Emirates for use in data centers. <!--

- **Market Dynamics and Sentiment:** <!-- Gemini -->
    - **Bitcoin's** recent decline in October was characterized as "Red October," but analysts at **Decrypt** believe the drop is a healthy, mid-cycle correction that could set the stage for a bullish November with potential targets up to $\$150,000$ by year-end.
