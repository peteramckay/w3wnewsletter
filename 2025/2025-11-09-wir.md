### Week in Review: Nov. 2-8, 2025

- **Bitcoin hit a fresh 2025 low,** dipping below the $100,000 threshold for the first time in months. Outflows from U.S.-listed bitcoin funds led the selloff, effectively extending a period of weakness traders dubbed "Red October." Since last month, U.S. bitcoin ETFs have shed $1.3 billion in investor money.

### Looking Ahead

- **McKinsey Reports on AI Agent Adoption and Scaling Challenges**
    A major global survey from McKinsey revealed that while 88% of organizations now report using AI in at least one business function, most are still struggling to scale AI programs across the enterprise, remaining in the experimentation or piloting phase. The survey also highlighted that 62% of organizations are experimenting with **AI agents**—systems that can autonomously plan and execute multi-step workflows—indicating agents are the next major focus area for corporate AI investment.
