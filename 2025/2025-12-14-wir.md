### Week in Review: Dec. 7-13, 2025

- **The Securities and Exchange Commission** effectively greenlighted blockchain-based trading of U.S.-listed securities for the first time. The market watchdog said the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., which financially guarantees all trades on Wall Street's public stock exchanges, can offer a tokenization service for approved assets, including constituents of the Russell 1000 stock index and U.S. Treasury debt. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/12/12/u-s-sec-gives-implicit-nod-for-tokenized-stocks))

- **New York's governor signed into law** America's first regulations requiring advertisers to disclose AI-generated content. But the new law could face a legal challenge from the federal Department of Justice. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/352132/new-york-mandates-ai-advertising-disclosures-faces-showdown-over-trump-executive-order))

- **Some welcome developments for crypto payments:** YouTube [enabled U.S. content creators](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2025/12/12/youtube-now-allows-content-creators-to-get-paid-in-paypal-s-stablecon-fortune) to receive their earnings in PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD... Meanwhile, payments startup N3XT, founded by former Signature Bank executives, launched [under a Wyoming banking charter](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/former-signature-bank-executives-launch-blockchain-based-bank-2025-12-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- **Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon received a 15-year prison sentence** in the U.S. for his role in the collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna coins in 2022. Investors lost $40 billion in the meltdown. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-gets-15-year-prison-sentence-14dfc220?st=8PhieT&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **A group of British lawmakers** is [urging the Bank of England](https://decrypt.co/352175/lawmakers-bank-england-stablecoin-proposals-limit-adoption) to reconsider proposals that would cap stablecoin holdings for citizens and businesses, citing concerns that such restrictions would deter innovation and limit adoption of digital finance in the UK. Separately, the UK's Labour Party and Liberal Democrats are [calling for a regulatory investigation](https://decrypt.co/351613/uk-political-parties-call-for-investigation-into-reform-uk-crypto-donations) into crypto-industry donations to the Nigel Farage's hard-right Reform UK.

### Looking Ahead

- **2026 could see the first $1 trillion tech IPO in the U.S.** Both OpenAI and Anthropic are reportedly planning initial stock listings on Wall Street that could break all previous records. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-plans-an-ipo-early-2026-ft-reports-2025-12-03/))  

- **A protracted takeover battle looms at Warner Brothers Discovery.** On Monday, Paramount Skydance [launched a hostile bid](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/08/paramount-skydance-warner-bros-discovery-explainer-hostile-bid) for the entirety of the media giant's holdings for $108 billion. The move came in reaction to an [announcement by Netflix](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros) on Dec. 5 that it had reached an agreement to buy Warner's movie studio and streaming businesses only for $83 billion, subject to shareholder approval. For a sharp analysis of the situation, I would recommend [Tuesday's episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7PO2Hw1DQo) of the Pivot podcast, made all the better by the split between co-hosts over which bid will and should win out ultimately. Veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher favors Netflix (as I did [in this newsletter](https://blog.pmckay.com/posts/20251207-netflix-wb-deal.html) last week). But entrepreneur/professor Scott Galloway leans more toward Paramount Skydance.

- **America's "Moondoggle:"** In Slate, Joel Achenbach [reports at length](https://slate.com/technology/2025/12/moon-space-nasa-mars-life-trump-elon-musk.html) about Artemis, the NASA mission that is supposed to return Americans to the moon by 2027. At least, that's the official policy. Behind the scenes, however, Achenbach says *a lot* is not going as planned, to the point that a new moon landing is almost certainly much further off than anyone in Washington will publicly admit.

### Odds & Ends

- **Ben Werdmuller still ❤️ RSS.** ProPublica's tech director says that despite often being dismissed as a "dead" technology, the humble Real Simple Syndication feed is still [widely used and thus a crucial standard](https://werd.io/why-rss-matters/) for distributing news across the web. By leveraging RSS, publishers can maintain control over their distribution, and readers can access the content they want without relying on algorithms or intermediaries.

- **MacKenzie Scott,** ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has [donated over $26 billion](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mackenzie-scott-worth-36-billion-171756906.html) to charity since their divorce, making her one of the world's most generous philanthropists. That includes almost $7.2 billion in giving in 2025, her most-active year yet. Bravo! 🎁
