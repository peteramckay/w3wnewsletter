**On paper,** Wall Street has experienced a [tech-led bull market](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/25/stock-market-records-technology) in 2025's first half, which  ends tomorrow. This scenario should ring familiar, as it's been the norm for most of the last decade-plus.

Yet this particular bull run hasn't exactly *felt* that way in practice, has it? Volatility [has spiked](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/tips-to-handle-stock-market-volatility), often due to the new White House's highly (ahem)  "improvisational"  style of making economic policy day-to-day. In particular, President Trump has rendered the future of global trade â€” and thus the dollar's role as [the world's reserve currency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT2cohNt6a4&pp=ygURcm9nb2ZmIGV6cmEga2xlaW4%3D) â€” far more uncertain. That has demonstrably carried real consequences at times for [economic expectations](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQOUVTZjg0VjY0M2IwSzZuTllpamFJUHpnVElDN0JiWDRYU1A4Vy1OM0hRQjJ1ZXlrNzdCaWNrWFpZeGllaDVKLWZGMlRfNU1FUi1oa0JpQThUT0U1bFlIUDJrRlZkRWo3dEUzSklhaHJfd1lSVjRrOVBIam03Mk9IZmhnclF3Z1BnN2k4Q3lfYU1SdW52VzhKUGE5ejFPNmxWZTJrUFdEMWE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) and investors' appetite for higher-risk bets on tech.

[Here's my scorecard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11XuSerOv1DG7vFWAkwoXehOe4G4xDMm6LSNL7SAL4vA/edit?usp=sharing) of major market indicators in the first half, comprising the year-to-date performance of broad measures of crypto, stocks, and more as of Friday's closing bell on Wall Street. We're still a day short of the first half's finish line, to be sure. But I figure it's better to crunch the numbers a little early than too late. ðŸ™ƒ

One other calendar-related update: I'll be taking next week off for the double "holiday" of U.S. Independence Day on the 4th and my birthday on the 6th. Will return to usual publication for w3w on July 13.

By the way, I share my birthday with the highly incongruous trio of the Dalai Lama, George W. Bush, and 50 Cent. That is perhaps a useful metaphor for the very mixed signals markets have been sending lately:

<!-- housekeeping/bday -->

<!-- String...

In tech, crypto is certainly benefiting from a clearer U.S. regulatory picture. But the Trump family's flagrant crypto-related conflicts of interest reflect poorly on rhe industry as a whole, creating fresh problems,

more hit-and-miss



**Lead item goes here.** Yadda yadda yadda.

A look at first-half markets. Quotes, factoids, etc. Also note up high that you're going to take next week off....

- **But gold is handily beating it as a safe haven.**

- Tech leadership has suffered post-tariff. The tech rally is expanding beyond the traditional "Magnificent Seven" stocks, with AI chip and data center trades, AI energy, and AI cloud trades emerging as top performers in the S&P 500 since the market bottomed on April 8. This shift suggests that the current bull market is driven by a broader theme of AI and tech, rather than individual stocks like Nvidia or other popular names. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-tech-rally-is-about-a-lot-more-than-magnificent-7-right-now-100031363.html <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->


- NVDA. Quote: https://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/NVDA/ | Nvidia's stock has seen a significant turnaround, rising to new highs after a successful ramp of its Blackwell chip line and increased interest in sovereign AI and physical AI. The company is benefiting from demand for its chips from hyperscalers and its own sovereign AI plans, which include establishing AI technology centers in several countries and deploying AI factories at a gigawatt scale. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-stark-turnaround-is-being-powered-by-robots-hyperscalers-and-sovereign-ai-200015463.html <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->


- Real AI use cases/demand: A recent NBC News Decision Desk Poll suggests that public adoption of AI chat tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, is on the rise, with 74% of adults having used one at some point and 44% using them regularly. However, the survey also reveals that many people believe that limiting AI use in schools could better prepare students for the future, highlighting ongoing reservations about the technology's impact. https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/american-attitudes-ai-today-mirror-poll-answers-rise-internet-90s-rcna213586 <!-- Draft by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->
