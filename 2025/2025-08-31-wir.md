### Five Things: Aug. 24-30, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **Crypto and stocks stumbled** late in the week on fears about the U.S. economy and the outlook for AI. Bitcoin fell below $110,000, nearing [a two-month low](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-risks-dollar100k-crash-as-us-china-economic-woes-take-hold). And chipmaker Nvidia's shares fell more than 3% Friday after issuing a mixed earnings report including a third-quarter sales forecast that missed analysts' expectations. Since Nvidia has been the market leader in selling components for AI devices, its results [sparked broader fears](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/27/nvidia-earnings-revenue-jensen-huang) that the recent boom in the entire AI sector might have gotten ahead of the technology's limitations for now.

- **The nonprofit A New Social launched** a public beta version of [Bounce](https://bounce.anew.social/?ref=w3wnews.substack.com), a tool for migrating a user's Bluesky account to Mastodon or Pixelfed, including follower lists and posts. Over time, advocates of the open, social sites known collectively as [the "fediverse"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) hope such functionality can become [an important advantage](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/bounce-launches-a-service-for-moving-accounts-between-bluesky-and-mastodon/) to attract users. By comparison, centralized incumbents like Instagram and Twitter tend to be highly reticent to allow users to move their data from one service to another.

- **Tether announced plans** to launch its USDT stablecoin on RGB, a protocol for issuing digital assets on the Bitcoin network. The move could prove particularly useful for pro crypto traders, who often use USDT to finance leveraged positions in the BTC token. ([Cryptonews](https://cryptonews.com/news/tether-stablecoin-usdt-coming-to-bitcoin-blockchain/))

- **Chainlink introduced** a new set of data feeds to publish U.S. Department of Commerce economic data across ten different blockchains. ([Blockworks](https://blockworks.co/news/chainlink-labs-commerce))

- **Elon Musk's startup xAI filed an antitrust suit** against Apple and OpenAI, alleging that the two companies are teaming up to stifle competition in artificial intelligence. Musk claims Apple's partnership with OpenAI has given OpenAI an unfair advantage, including preferable treatment in its mobile App Store for OpenAI's ChatGPT app over xAI's Grok. ([AP](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-apple-openai-chatgpt-8cc360bd419894ad8c6bfdd79eb5693f))

### Looking Ahead

**The Wall Stret Journal's David Luhnow and Tom Fairless** recently published a [fascinating deep dive](https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europe-is-losing-fe179376?st=XeCdCn&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about Europe's economic competitiveness and innovation. Like many journalists who have previously tackled this topic, they describe the region as less dynamic in many respects than America or China.

That said, the Journal's coverage did add certain details to the narrative that I found truly surprising, like this one about space exploration:

>*"On May 13, Elon Muskâ€™s SpaceX launched 28 satellites into orbit in a single day, one of over 100 successful U.S. orbital launches this year. China has sent more than 40 rockets into space since January. Russia, bogged down by war in Ukraine, has launched 10 rockets."*
>
>*"Europe, by contrast, has launched four."*

Ouch.

Other developing tech stories to watch:

- **A congressman in the Phillipines** has introduced a bill proposing creation of a national bitcoin reserve holding 10,000 tokens. ([Cryptonews](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philippines-proposes-massive-10-000-172644985.html))

- **Startups are racing to develop new batteries** using materials like sodium and sulfur as an alternative to the dominant lithium-ion devices that power electric vehicles and other electronics. The goal is to lower costs and reduce reliance on China, which dominates the lithium-ion market. ([Reuters](https://news.google.com/read/CBMitgFBVV95cUxPT2hWaEFkZDhnQy16YjJpZFFVSklTMXNLVW51VFdDSC05OU9FYURXNUZ6Z2hNc3V2Q2h5elJQODJFemthWFJ2ZV8taV9mWVlQd3RhZFMtTEtmN2JOS0UyV21FMDRBWnl5bnVEOGUxQWJXMjBoOUozWktramt1bTlaeDdGQXZYRV9sMG9WZ3lxSzNlQUhNU0RoQ1lRMC1xNF9vZG9WS0J1RHE0SlRmZnpSN2w5MjVfdw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

### Odds & Ends

- **Fallingwater has leaks to fix.** Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural masterpiece is undergoing a $7 million renovation, with painstaking attention to preserving important historical elements. ([Washington Post](https://wapo.st/4mJ4XeM))

- **For once, a crypto-free fraud case:** A Tennessee man has been charged with 91 counts of mail fraud, identity theft, and other crimes for impersonating baseball legend Babe Ruth and other deceased or retired players in submitting false claims in class-action lawsuit settlements. How quaint. ([New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/08/26/sports/babe-ruth-arrested-for-using-baseball-legends-names-in-fraud-scheme/))
