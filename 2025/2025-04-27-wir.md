### Five Things: April 20-26, 2025

*The week's top headlines about blockchain, AI, and other emerging technologies and trends re-shaping the web:*

- **Bitcoin's valuation briefly surpassed that of Google's parent Alphabet.** The cryptocurrency also became the world's [fifth-largest asset](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/23/bitcoin-becomes-fifth-largest-global-asset-surpasses-google-s-market-cap) by market capitalization. However, a [strong earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-stock-rises-after-it-beats-on-earnings-raises-dividend-and-authorizes-70-billion-in-buybacks-192027323.html) from Alphabet helped it recover ground later in the week. As of Friday's close on Wall Street, Alphabet was valued at $TK trillion versus $TK trillion for bitcoin... <!-- Update after Friday's close. --> An [improved](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-considers-exempting-some-goods-us-tariffs-source-says-2025-04-25/) outlook on tariffs helped propel riskier assets like stocks and crypto throughout the week. That said, fears of a [possible U.S. recession](https://www.yahoo.com/news/imf-raises-us-recession-risk-192909541.html) are likely to simmer awhile longer.

- **Big Tech's antitrust woes piled up in court.** The U.S. Justice Department told a federal judge in Washington it believes [Google should be broken up](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPb0J4YWpWUW1aSXZUeUdkT0lPUnNvWFRIYzRRaWVhUmFzSlduSUNNWGpzRGxlT0xhaWtJU0J3ZVlPUWJkamhhY2xtZXV6TTVOOWZNUElYODV3dVFIRGxKcTN4Y0Z2U2l4OWR0d1djeXJBZDROS0xSLWU5QXNHOVpTYjk0QUxvckww?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen), including a sale of its Chrome browser. Google's lawyers are pushing for a narrower set of remedies... Meanwhile, in Meta's antitrust trial, the government introduced into evidence internal company emails in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed a possible spin-off of Instagram due to concerns it was ["cannibalizing"](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/mark-zuckerberg-once-suggested-spinning-out-instagram-as-a-solution-to-its-cannibalization-of-facebook/) Facebook's user engagement.

- **Newsweek has been all over stories about real-life AI use cases lately.** Funny enough, I must confess I only noticed this with some help from NotebookLM. Among the [recent stories](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/artificial-intelligence) covered by Newsweek's tech team: Bipedial robots [racing humans](https://www.newsweek.com/robots-race-humans-beijing-half-marathon-2025) in a Beijing half-marathon, a study in Dubai finding that one-third of government jobs there are at risk of being [replaced by AI](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-impact-artificial-intelligence-dubai-uae-2062953), a startup using AI to [enhance the customer experience](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-enabled-electric-vehicle-charging-coming-this-year-2062193) for charging electric vehicles, and U.S. healthcare companies' tentative steps to use AI to [optimize revenue](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-powered-claims-tools-healthcare-revenue-cycle-access-health-2062141).  
- **Paul Atkins was sworn in as a pro-crypto SEC chair.** He thus [replaces](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/04/22/Paul-Atkins-sworn-in-sec-chairman/6911745372094/) Gary Gensler, the Biden-era appointee widely despised in the industry for waging what many executives regarded as an overzealous crackdown by the securities regulator... But that's not to say the transition will be easy for Atkins. He immediately [faces pressure](https://www.ibtimes.com/new-sec-chair-paul-atkins-under-pressure-72-crypto-related-etf-applications-xrp-leads-filings-3770850) to decide on 72 pending crypto-related applications to list new exchange-traded funds, with Ripple leading the filings. Plus there's the uncanny tendency of his boss and other senior administration officials to [do things](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/23/trump-coin-jumps-70-on-president-s-dinner-event-for-top-token-holders) concerning crypto that would likely be called "insider trading" if they were to happen in the stock market.

- **Stablecoins are getting more intertwined with traditional banking.** Circle, the company behind the $60 billion USDC stablecoin, launched a [new payments network](https://www.theblock.co/post/351720/circle-launches-payments-network-to-connect-banks-and-stablecoins). This initiative aims to connect stablecoins with traditional banking systems, enabling faster and more efficient transactions. The move is expected to strengthen the role of stablecoins in global finance. As stablecoins like USDC become more integrated with banks, the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co)) | Crypto exchanges are increasingly [launching](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-moving-into-wall-street-growing-synergy) traditional investment offerings, signaling a convergence between the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) spaces. This move aims to provide investors with more flexibility and access to both worlds. Key players like Kraken and Coinbase are leading the charge, with some seeing TradFi as a safety net and others as a launchpad for broader adoption. |  The CME Group plans to [launch XRP futures](https://www.theblock.co/post/351899/cme-group-plans-to-launch-xrp-futures-its-fourth-ever-crypto-add) within a month, pending regulatory review, marking its fourth foray into cryptocurrency offerings. This move follows the company's listing of Solana futures and reflects its increasing interest in crypto amid shifting regulatory circumstances in the U.S. XRP, with a market capitalization of over $127 billion, is seen as a natural expansion for the CME given its institutional-friendly blockchain and partnerships with major financial institutions.

**Stablecoins are getting more intertwined with traditional banking.** *Circle Launches New Payments Network* Circle, the company behind the $60 billion USDC stablecoin, is launching a new payments and cross-border remittance network, aiming to rival Mastercard and Visa. The network, initially targeting remittances, is seen as a strategic move to consolidate Circle's position in the payments space, leveraging the growing adoption of stablecoins for global money transfers. [Link](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/04/21/stablecoin-giant-circle-is-launching-a-new-payments-and-remittance-network) | *Crypto firms are making a push to integrate with traditional banking, with several planning to apply for bank charters or licenses.* This move comes as the Trump administration works to incorporate crypto into mainstream finance, with Congress advancing legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and allow them to operate under stricter oversight.

### Looking Ahead

*I'm adding a new section this week to cover specific tech events and developments coming up.  If you have conferences, award competitions, or similar time-sensitive stuff in the works, this is a place I'd like to share such info in future updates. Please email me the details at peter[at]w3w[dot]media.* ðŸ“¬

- **In North America, further tests of crypto's political influence loom.** Both leading candidates for prime minister in Canada have discussed crypto policy while campaigning ahead of Monday's snap elections. But it's hardly been a centerpiece of the race, [according to CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/04/23/previewing-the-canadian-elections-crypto-angle). More conventional economic issues like housing and the country's strained diplomatic relationship with the U.S. have garnered far more attention from voters... In Washington, Decrypt's DeSander Lutz [reports](https://decrypt.co/315996/crypto-company-coinbase-stop-pro-crypto-bill-passing) that Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz have unexpectedly become opponents of standalone passage of a stablecoin bill. The industry giants would instead like to see the issue folded into the broader crypto bill dubbed FIT21. That strategy has rankled other industry players, according to Decrypt.

- **The web3 studio Mythical Games** plans to release a FIFA-inspired football game for mobile devices [in June](https://www.theblock.co/post/351731/crypto-fifa-video-game-launching-on-mobile-devices-in-june).

- **Decrypt's Jose Antonio Lanz** says open-source AI video generators like SkyReels and FramePack are [increasingly competitive](https://decrypt.co/316027/open-source-video-generators-full-length-movies) with their proprietary cousins, pushing boundaries in video length and other features. Hmmm...

### Odds & Ends

- **Robots suck at making Nikes.** Sneakers' complex designs and temperature-sensitive materials that change slightly according to the weather tend to thwart automation. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/why-its-so-difficult-for-robots-to-make-your-nike-sneakers-47b882b5?st=uLg1h4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

-  **People are using cannabis as... a pre-workout supplement?** Sounds like a terrible idea to me. But hey. Whatever gets you through Mile 26. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/19/couch-potatoes-no-more-stoners-are-using-cannabis-to-help-them-exercise-and-reach-a-runners-high/))
