I would like to use the attached image in my newsletter, as the central figure reading a newspaper is really interesting to me. But the image is not wide enough. Could you please widen it by extending the background and foreground elements, such as the table and curtain?

### Looking Ahead

- De-dollarization? <!-- Recent JPM remark on it being more plausible post-tariffs. Coinbase analysts warn of a potential "crypto winter" due to the ongoing trade war and decreased investor confidence. Bitcoin's price is currently above its 200-day moving average, but has shown volatility in recent weeks.

-  **People are using cannabis as... a pre-workout supplement?** Sounds like a terrible idea to me. But hey. Whatever gets you through Mile 26. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/19/couch-potatoes-no-more-stoners-are-using-cannabis-to-help-them-exercise-and-reach-a-runners-high/))
