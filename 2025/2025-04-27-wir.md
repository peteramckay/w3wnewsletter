Latter version is much closer to what we'll ultimately need. For now, I'll include Copilot's drafts in the list below, with old Leo versions commented out to preserve links I might want to restore later.

### Five Things: April 20-26, 2025

*The week's top headlines about blockchain, AI, and other emerging technologies and trends re-shaping the web:*

- **Markets show mixed signals:** Bitcoin experienced a significant rally early in the week, boosting confidence among crypto investors. Stock markets also saw gains, supported by optimism around improved tariff negotiations. However, concerns linger as the Dow remains on track for its worst month since the Great Depression. Analysts are debating whether this is a temporary setback or part of a larger economic trend. ([MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com))

<!-- Old Leo version
- **Markets:** <!-- Big bicoin rally early in the week. Stocks looking better as well, with improved tariff outlook. But the Dow may still be headed for its worst month since the Depression.  Bitcoin's price has [recovered to $94,000](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/25/bitcoin-whales-return-in-force-buy-the-btc-price-rally-on-chain-data-show), with large investors, known as "whales," buying up coins from the market. According to Glassnode's data, wallets holding over 10,000 BTC have a high accumulation trend score, indicating significant buying activity. This trend suggests that investors are adopting a long-term holding strategy, with outflows from centralized exchanges reaching a two-year high. | Bitcoin has [reached a new milestone](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/23/bitcoin-becomes-fifth-largest-global-asset-surpasses-google-s-market-cap), becoming the fifth-largest asset globally by market capitalization, with a value of $1.86 trillion. This achievement surpasses tech giant Google, with Bitcoin's price breaking above $94,000. The renewed optimism in the market is attributed to easing tensions in the U.S.–China tariff trade war, which has fueled gains for both Bitcoin and tech stocks. | *Bitcoin ETFs Experience Surge in Investments* American investors poured [nearly $1 billion](https://decrypt.co/315966/bitcoin-etfs-bounce-back-billion-day) into Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday, marking the highest amount since January. This surge comes as the price of Bitcoin has risen to its highest point since early March, with the largest cryptocurrency by market value up almost 14% over the past 14 days. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust led the surge, with $267 million and $193.5 million in net inflows, respectively. | This deal marks the [largest financing facility of its kind](https://decrypt.co/315987/sol-strategies-secures-500m-buy-more-solana) in the Solana ecosystem, with SOL Strategies aiming to become the leading institutional staking platform. The move comes as Solana's price has surged over 20% in the past two weeks, outpacing Bitcoin. | Bitcoin is showing [signs of maturity](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-decouples-from-stocks-gains-safe-haven-status) as a global asset, decoupling from the US stock market and trading more like precious metals, according to Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik. Despite ongoing trade tensions and rising recession odds, Bitcoin's price has staged a 12% recovery over the past two weeks. This resilience is attributed to its growing role as a safe-haven asset and potential benefits from regulatory development and the US Bitcoin Reserve. | Crypto exchanges are increasingly [launching](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-firms-moving-into-wall-street-growing-synergy) traditional investment offerings, signaling a convergence between the crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) spaces. This move aims to provide investors with more flexibility and access to both worlds. Key players like Kraken and Coinbase are leading the charge, with some seeing TradFi as a safety net and others as a launchpad for broader adoption. | A Solana whale has reportedly [accumulated](https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-whale-153-million-profit-staking-4-years) over $153 million in unrealized gains after staking nearly 1 million tokens at a price of $27 in 2021, with the tokens now worth around $166 million. The whale recently started offloading a portion of the tokens, sending 100,000 SOL to Binance. This move comes as Solana briefly overtook Ethereum in staking market cap before reclaiming its position. | The CME Group plans to [launch XRP futures](https://www.theblock.co/post/351899/cme-group-plans-to-launch-xrp-futures-its-fourth-ever-crypto-add) within a month, pending regulatory review, marking its fourth foray into cryptocurrency offerings. This move follows the company's listing of Solana futures and reflects its increasing interest in crypto amid shifting regulatory circumstances in the U.S. XRP, with a market capitalization of over $127 billion, is seen as a natural expansion for the CME given its institutional-friendly blockchain and partnerships with major financial institutions. | According to a recent report from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, Americans aged 60 and older lost nearly $3 billion to crypto fraud in 2024, despite making up only 17% of the population. This demographic accounted for 30% of the total crypto fraud losses, with an average loss of $83,000 per victim. The FBI has attributed the rise in crypto fraud to scams such as ATM and kiosk fraud, which saw incidents almost double from 2023 to 2024. [Read the full story](https://www.example.com)

The case, which has been ongoing since 2020, involves allegations that Google has been stifling competition and innovation, and could have significant implications for the tech industry. | The Justice Department is [urging](https://www.wsj.com/tech/google-justice-department-search-monopoly-hearing-d527c010?st=8x7TPT&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) a federal judge to force Google to loosen its grip on the search engine market by selling its Chrome web browser, as part of a landmark antitrust case. The move, which could result in new limits on Google, comes after a major ruling against the company in a separate antitrust case, and has been backed by more than 30 state attorneys general. | In a surprising twist, internal emails from 2018 [have surfaced](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/mark-zuckerberg-once-suggested-spinning-out-instagram-as-a-solution-to-its-cannibalization-of-facebook/) showing that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning out Instagram as a separate business due to concerns that its growth was cannibalizing Facebook's user engagement. According to the emails, Zuckerberg proposed building bridges between Meta's apps to prevent this cannibalization and even suggested rebranding Instagram and WhatsApp to emphasize Facebook's dominance.

- **In North America, further tests of crypto's political influence loom.** Both leading candidates for prime minister in Canada have discussed crypto policy while campaigning ahead of Monday's snap elections. But it's hardly been a centerpiece of the race, [according to CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/04/23/previewing-the-canadian-elections-crypto-angle). More conventional economic issues like housing and the country's strained diplomatic relationship with the U.S. have garnered far more attention from voters... In Washington, Decrypt's DeSander Lutz [reports](https://decrypt.co/315996/crypto-company-coinbase-stop-pro-crypto-bill-passing) that Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz have unexpectedly become opponents of standalone passage of a stablecoin bill. The industry giants would instead like to see the issue folded into the broader crypto bill dubbed FIT21. That strategy has rankled other industry players, according to Decrypt.
