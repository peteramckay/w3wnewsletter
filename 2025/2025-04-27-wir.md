**Among several AI apps I've been trying,** Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) has some features I've been finding particularly relevant for working on w3w, and to journalism in general.

I highlight this because I know a number of journalists read the newsletter. If you're looking for a place to kickstart your own learning about AI, NotebookLM could be a great option.

Here are what I consider NotebookLM's journalism-specific strengths. Admittedly, you might be able to replicate these with some other AI tool, among a dizzying list of options that's growing everyday. But in my experience so far, it's hard to beat NotebookLM's combination of...

- **Familiarity:** The metaphor of a notebook should be accessible to any reporter, as the ink-and-paper variety are such an essential tool of the trade. NotebookLM does live up to its name aptly as a place for capturing information on the go. There are simple features for you to take notes of your own, with the option to either store them in the traditional way or turn them into training data for the AI. If you do the latter, NotebookLM's chatbot features effectively become a research assistant to make the information more useful.

- **Customizability:** You can also add documents, research reports, interview transcripts, hyperlinks and other information as training data for NotebookLM. Thus, if you're covering a particular beat, you can make the app more expert at it to complement your own knowledge.

- **Transparency:** The options to add or remove training data yourself make NotebookLM much less of a "black box" than other AI tools I've tried. If you ask it questions in its chat tab, NotebookLM doesn't just tell you what it knows. You can understand pretty clearly *how* it knows what it knows -- a very important distinction in a newsroom.

As in many other fields, I think the sweet spot for journalists right now is *collaboration* with useful AIs. I can definitely see where these things, if used properly, could make a person more effective and productive at the job.

I would also say the anxiety (or in some cases eagerness) for AI to straight-up replace journalists is overblown at this point. I frankly don't think NotebookLM or any other chatbot tool I've seen meets those requirements yet.

Could that change at some point? Maybe. But for now, if journalist friends were to ask me for advice, I would say the biggest risk I see for you isn't being replaced by an AI. It's being replaced by a person who knows how to use AI more adroitly than you do. So just get going with it in some way that you're comfortable with.

### Five Things: April 20-26, 2025

*The week's top headlines about blockchain, AI, and other emerging technologies and trends re-shaping the web:*

- **Bitcoin's valuation briefly surpassed that of Google's parent Alphabet.** The cryptocurrency also became the world's [fifth-largest asset](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/23/bitcoin-becomes-fifth-largest-global-asset-surpasses-google-s-market-cap) by market capitalization. However, a [strong earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-stock-rises-after-it-beats-on-earnings-raises-dividend-and-authorizes-70-billion-in-buybacks-192027323.html) from Alphabet helped it recover ground later in the week. Heading into Monday's open on Wall Street, Alphabet is valued at $1.95 trillion versus $1.87 trillion for bitcoin... An [improved](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-considers-exempting-some-goods-us-tariffs-source-says-2025-04-25/) outlook on tariffs helped propel riskier assets like stocks and crypto throughout the week. That said, fears of a [possible U.S. recession](https://www.yahoo.com/news/imf-raises-us-recession-risk-192909541.html) are likely to simmer awhile longer.

- **Big Tech's antitrust woes piled up in court.** The U.S. Justice Department told a federal judge in Washington it believes [Google should be broken up](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPb0J4YWpWUW1aSXZUeUdkT0lPUnNvWFRIYzRRaWVhUmFzSlduSUNNWGpzRGxlT0xhaWtJU0J3ZVlPUWJkamhhY2xtZXV6TTVOOWZNUElYODV3dVFIRGxKcTN4Y0Z2U2l4OWR0d1djeXJBZDROS0xSLWU5QXNHOVpTYjk0QUxvckww?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen), including a sale of its Chrome browser. Google's lawyers are pushing for a narrower set of remedies... Meanwhile, in Meta's antitrust trial, the government introduced into evidence internal company emails in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg weighed a possible spin-off of Instagram due to concerns it was ["cannibalizing"](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/mark-zuckerberg-once-suggested-spinning-out-instagram-as-a-solution-to-its-cannibalization-of-facebook/) Facebook's user engagement.

- **Paul Atkins was sworn in as a pro-crypto SEC chair.** He thus [replaces](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/04/22/Paul-Atkins-sworn-in-sec-chairman/6911745372094/) Gary Gensler, the Biden-era appointee widely despised in the industry for waging what many executives regarded as an overzealous crackdown... But that's not to say the transition will be easy for Atkins. He immediately [faces pressure](https://www.ibtimes.com/new-sec-chair-paul-atkins-under-pressure-72-crypto-related-etf-applications-xrp-leads-filings-3770850) to decide on 72 pending crypto-related applications to list new exchange-traded funds, with Ripple leading the filings. Plus there's the uncanny tendency of his boss's family to [participate in crypto markets](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/23/trump-coin-jumps-70-on-president-s-dinner-event-for-top-token-holders) personally in ways that would likely be called "insider trading" if they were to occur in the stock market.

- **Stablecoins are getting more intertwined with traditional banking in America.** Circle, the company behind the $60 billion USDC stablecoin, [launched a new network](https://www.theblock.co/post/351720/circle-launches-payments-network-to-connect-banks-and-stablecoins) for payments and cross-border remittances. As stablecoins like USDC and rival Tether [increasingly become integrated](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-knocks-on-the-door-of-a-banking-world-that-shut-it-out-082b3968?st=zDQWDU&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) with consumers' everyday transactions, some companies in the sector are even applying for traditional bank charters or licenses. Such moves would have been unthinkable just a few years ago in the wake of FTX's meltdown, when conventional finance firms scrambled to cut ties with the crypto industry.

- **Newsweek has been all over stories about real-life AI use cases lately.** Funny enough, I must confess I only noticed this with some help from NotebookLM. Among the [recent stories](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/artificial-intelligence) covered by Newsweek's tech team: Bipedial robots [racing humans](https://www.newsweek.com/robots-race-humans-beijing-half-marathon-2025) in a Beijing half-marathon, a study in Dubai finding that one-third of government jobs there are at risk of being [replaced by an AI](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-impact-artificial-intelligence-dubai-uae-2062953), a startup using AI to [enhance the customer experience](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-enabled-electric-vehicle-charging-coming-this-year-2062193) for charging electric vehicles, and U.S. healthcare companies' tentative steps to use AI to [optimize revenue](https://www.newsweek.com/ai-powered-claims-tools-healthcare-revenue-cycle-access-health-2062141).  

### Looking Ahead

*I'm adding a new section this week to cover specific tech events and developments coming up. If you have conferences, award competitions, or similar time-sensitive stuff in the works, this is a place I'd like to share such info in future updates. Please email me the details at peter[at]w3w[dot]media.* ðŸ“¬

- **In North America, further tests of crypto's political influence loom.** Both leading candidates for prime minister in Canada have discussed crypto policy while campaigning ahead of Monday's snap elections. But it's hardly been a centerpiece of the race, [according to CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/04/23/previewing-the-canadian-elections-crypto-angle)... In Washington, Decrypt's DeSander Lutz [reports](https://decrypt.co/315996/crypto-company-coinbase-stop-pro-crypto-bill-passing) that Coinbase and Andreessen Horowitz have unexpectedly become opponents of standalone passage of a stablecoin bill. The industry giants would instead like to see the issue folded into the broader crypto bill dubbed FIT21. That strategy has rankled other industry players, according to Decrypt.

- **The web3 studio Mythical Games** plans to release a FIFA-inspired football game for mobile devices [in June](https://www.theblock.co/post/351731/crypto-fifa-video-game-launching-on-mobile-devices-in-june).

- **Decrypt's Jose Antonio Lanz** says open-source AI video generators like SkyReels and FramePack are [increasingly competitive](https://decrypt.co/316027/open-source-video-generators-full-length-movies) with their proprietary cousins, pushing boundaries in video length and other features. Hmmm...

### Odds & Ends

- **Robots suck at making Nikes.** Sneakers' complex designs and temperature-sensitive materials that change slightly according to the weather tend to thwart automation. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/why-its-so-difficult-for-robots-to-make-your-nike-sneakers-47b882b5?st=uLg1h4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

-  **People are using cannabis as... a pre-workout supplement?** Sounds like a terrible idea to me. But hey. Whatever gets you through Mile 26. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/19/couch-potatoes-no-more-stoners-are-using-cannabis-to-help-them-exercise-and-reach-a-runners-high/))
