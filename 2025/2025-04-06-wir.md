<!-- 150-word lead item. Some possibilities...

- GOUP: One of the subtle bad ideas of the Trump admin is that its fixing the frame of 'number go up' around blockchain technology.

- BOYCOTTS: Why withholding money from a publicly traded company works. You only need to deny marginal metrics, not move them to zero in absolute terms.

2. Encryption for me but not for thee.

3. Encryption will not protect systems or organizations from human error.

If you are oblivious enough to copy a magazine editor on the message string where you're planning to bomb a foreign country, no form of encryption or any other technology will save you. The solution is to be smarter and do better, full stop.

The same goes if you want to encrypt pictures of your kids or a conversation with your spouse or one with your boss or anything else.

Crucible Capital's Meltem Demirors says a lot of bitcoin ETF have proven to be "arbitrage buyers." They're buying shares, shorting bitcoin, and profiting on the spread.

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_

 _**If you need to reach me directly for any reason, please email peter[at]w3w[dot]media.**_

 _**Best wishes for a healthy and productive week ahead.**_ ðŸ˜Š
