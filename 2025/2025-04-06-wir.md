<!-- 150-word lead item. Some possibilities...

- SBFPARDON: Possible pardon of Sam Bankman-Fried would be awful for the crypto industry.

- QUARTERLY: Wrap up a bunch of market factoids for the first quarter.

- GOUP: One of the subtle bad ideas of the Trump admin is that its fixing the frame of 'number go up' around blockchain technology.

- BOYCOTTS: Why withholding money from a publicly traded company works. You only need to deny marginal metrics, not move them to zero in absolute terms.

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_
