### Week in Review: Sept. 21-27, 2025

- A7, a sanctions-evasion firm linked to a ruble-backed stablecoin, is reportedly facilitating Russian influence in Moldovan elections through crypto payments to politicians and activist networks, according to leaked texts and on-chain data. The findings suggest covert Russian involvement, though direct ties to the Kremlin remain unproven. ([BeInCrypto](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-reportedly-uses-crypto-influence-224145166.html)) <!-- Draft summary item by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- **Moody’s warned** that the rapid growth of crypto adoption in emerging markets—particularly in everyday uses like savings and remittances—could undermine monetary sovereignty and weaken financial resilience. The report highlighted stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar as a key concern, noting their potential to erode the effectiveness of domestic currencies and monetary policy, with global crypto ownership climbing to about 562 million people in 2024, up 33% from the prior year. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/09/26/crypto-adoption-in-emerging-markets-poses-risks-to-financial-resilience-moody-s)) <!-- Draft news summary by ChatGPT -->

- China has reportedly asked brokers to pause real-world asset business in Hong Kong, according to sources, as part of efforts to address concerns around the virtual asset sector. This move comes amid growing scrutiny of the rapidly evolving crypto and digital asset landscape in the region. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/china-ask-brokers-pause-real-world-asset-business-hong-kong-sources-say-2025-09-23/)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->







- **Dealwatch:** SoftBank Group and Ark Invest are reportedly in discussions to participate in a major funding round for Tether, which could value the stablecoin issuer at up to $500 billion, as the company seeks to raise $15–20 billion for a 3% equity stake. This development could further solidify Tether’s position in mainstream finance.([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/341639/tether-investors-funding-round-softbank-ark-report)) <!-- Draft summary item by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | US regulators are investigating potential insider trading related to stock movements before companies announced their cryptocurrency and treasury strategies, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. This probe highlights growing scrutiny over financial disclosures and market integrity in the evolving crypto landscape. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/sec-crypto-treasury-deal-trading-21d631ae?st=NDypyo&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)) <!-- Draft summary item by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | Kraken is in talks with a strategic investor to raise $200 million to $300 million at a $20 billion valuation ahead of its planned IPO in early 2026, according to Bloomberg. The move comes as the crypto exchange expands its operations and prepares for a potential public offering amid a growing convergence of digital assets and traditional financial markets. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/372627/kraken-mulls-potential-investor-at-20-billion-valuation-ahead-of-planned-ipo-bloomberg)) <!-- Draft summary item by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | Struggling crypto-hoarding companies are turning to share buybacks in an attempt to boost their stock prices, signaling the potential end of the "crypto treasury" trend as some firms face declining valuations and market saturation.

- **Token prices tumbled.** Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, plummeted in value, with liquidations exceeding $1 billion in a 24-hour period. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including a drop in the stock market and a decrease in institutional investment, with analysts predicting that interest rate cuts could potentially benefit Bitcoin and other risk assets in the future. ([Decrypt](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-dive-crypto-174803031.html)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> Gold up 6 weeks in a row. <!-- Link TK --> | Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum prices continued their decline ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the PCE data, which could influence future interest rate decisions and impact crypto markets. The potential outcome of the data—whether it shows higher or lower inflation—could either deepen the slump or provide a catalyst for a rebound in digital assets. ([Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-price-xrp-ethereum-crypto-slump-b7bff44d)) <!-- Draft summary item by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> |  The number of crypto millionaires and billionaires has surged by 40% and 29%, respectively, driven largely by Bitcoin's 78% price increase over the past year, according to a new report by Henley & Partners. This growth highlights the expanding role of cryptocurrency in global wealth creation and institutional adoption.

### Looking Ahead

- Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlights the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, scheduled for December 3, 2025, as a pivotal upgrade that could significantly boost Ethereum’s scalability and bring it closer to mainstream adoption through innovations like PeerDAS. This upgrade aims to address data bottlenecks, reduce transaction costs, and pave the way for a more accessible decentralized future. ([CCN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vitalik-buterin-says-fusaka-could-094715641.html)) <!-- Draft summary item by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Web3's growth depends on strategic integration with existing Web2 systems rather than replacing them, as highlighted by Richard Johnson of Data Guardians Network, who argues that leveraging Web2's established infrastructure can help overcome barriers to mass adoption and drive innovation. ([Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-rely-on-web2)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- **Turnabout is fair play.** Travel sites like Booking.com, Expedia, and Airbnb, which once put scores of human travel agents out of business, are now working to avoid being replaced themselves by AI agents. ([Financial Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9nc2tGV0tieE1aZFplam9tNW81WWMydGV3UHVicnZ6bTExcXQ0TFN4dll3NjBsYUtGUGI4Q3lWdVlpa29XQUtFMUdNRDB5WVBvRkJ6bGYtd2dINWY2NThySW82SnQ0aVJ6VnMya1d6WS0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

### Odds & Ends

- A new modular construction company, Reframe, is revolutionizing urban housing by building apartments in just a week using factory-assembled modules, significantly reducing construction time and costs compared to traditional methods. This approach could offer a scalable and efficient solution to the ongoing housing crisis, particularly in cities where construction has become increasingly slow and expensive. ([Slate](https://slate.com/business/2025/09/modular-housing-apartments-boston-reframe.html)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->


- **A new study suggests** that even a single exercise session could slow the growth of cancer cells. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/11/exercise-cancer-benefits-prevention-recurrence/))

- **ICYMI:** Basketball star and Coinbase investor Kevin Durant recently regained access to a crypto wallet hosted by the exchange that he's been locked out of since 2016. At the time, he used the wallet to buy bitcoin around $650 per token. It's since risen 17,700%.

- **TikTok deal:** President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the sale of a controlling stake in TikTok's U.S. operations to a group of American investors, valued at $14 billion, in a deal that aims to keep the app available to U.S. users while ensuring their data is protected from foreign influence.
