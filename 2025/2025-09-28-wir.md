Crypto treasury companies are hitting

- US regulators are investigating potential insider trading related to stock movements before companies announced their cryptocurrency and treasury strategies, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. This probe highlights growing scrutiny over financial disclosures and market integrity in the evolving crypto landscape. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/sec-crypto-treasury-deal-trading-21d631ae?st=NDypyo&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- Struggling crypto-hoarding companies are turning to share buybacks in an attempt to boost their stock prices, signaling the potential end of the "crypto treasury" trend as some firms face declining valuations and market saturation. ([Financial Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMicEFVX3lxTE0yNVZZRE56eGdsUzk0azZCc3diMElsTFUwRnZfZTdCQ25zbXRUNTh2R1J1QVlHNTNMTmlWVkRrR2t1N0RsUWhRYTlmdW1uY2pxZHQtbWVUZG9rVzlSd1RCTDJnejJEUXdzY1NTcFVpM2Q?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- Kraken is in talks with a strategic investor to raise $200 million to $300 million at a $20 billion valuation ahead of its planned IPO in early 2026, according to Bloomberg. The move comes as the crypto exchange expands its operations and prepares for a potential public offering amid a growing convergence of digital assets and traditional financial markets.

- **TikTok deal:** President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing the sale of a controlling stake in TikTok's U.S. operations to a group of American investors, valued at $14 billion, in a deal that aims to keep the app available to U.S. users while ensuring their data is protected from foreign influence. ([Variety](https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-executive-order-tiktok-us-sale-deal-1236529242/)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B  

- TikTok's US business is at the center of a proposed $14 billion sale, with experts arguing that the price tag is undervalued, citing the app's lucrative revenue and popularity. The deal, backed by President Donald Trump, would carve out TikTok's US operations into a new joint venture, reducing ByteDance's stake to below 20% and addressing national security concerns.

- A fifth of U.S. adults now regularly get news on TikTok, with the platform seeing a sharp increase in news consumption, especially among younger users—43% of adults under 30 rely on TikTok for news, up from 9% in 2020.

### Week in Review: Sept. 21-27, 2025

- **Token prices tumbled** as traders [unwound leveraged positions](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560604990180). Worries about the U.S. economy and the expiration of listed options contracts Friday fueled the selloff. Bitcoin tumbled more than 5% to a new one-month low, and ether was off 10% for the week. Meanwhile, the most old-school financial safe haven of all benefited from traders' newly cautious mood: Gold jumped nearly 4%, nearing its first-ever close above [$4,000 per ounce](https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2025-09-24/4000-gold-real-possibility-literally-millions-ounces-still-be-purchased) in New York trading.

- **But over the longer term, crypto's performance still looks impressive.** Bitcoin is up more than 75% over the last 12 months, including a 16% gain in 2025 so far. Those gains have pushed the number of crypto millionaires up 40%, and crypto billionaires up 29% globally over the last 12 months, according to a [new report](https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/crypto-wealth-report-2025#contributors) by the consulting firm Henley & Partners.

- **Moody’s warned** that the rapid growth of crypto adoption in emerging markets — particularly for everyday use cases like savings and remittances — could undermine monetary sovereignty and weaken financial resilience. In particular, the report highlighted adoption of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar as a key concern, noting their potential to erode the effectiveness of domestic currencies and monetary policy. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/09/26/crypto-adoption-in-emerging-markets-poses-risks-to-financial-resilience-moody-s))

- **China's Securities Regulatory Commission** advised some brokerages in Hong Kong to pause tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) for clients. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/china-ask-brokers-pause-real-world-asset-business-hong-kong-sources-say-2025-09-23/))

- **The analytics firm Elliptic** said that leaked data from businesses controlled by Moldovan founder Ilan Shor shed new light on those companies' role in [facilitating Russian interference](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-a7-leaks-the-role-of-crypto-in-russian-sanctions-evasion-and-election-interference) in Moldova's elections [this weekend](https://apnews.com/video/moldovans-head-to-polls-in-election-plagued-by-claims-of-russian-interference-219394cef2cf4d0bb1a89a92b2cb22d7). In particular, Elliptic says crypto wallets associated with Shor's company A7 have received $8 billion in stablecoin transactions over the past 18 months, much of it used to manage and pay a network of political activists in Moldova.

### Looking Ahead

- **SoftBank Group and Ark Invest** are reportedly in discussions to participate in a major funding round for Tether that would value the stablecoin issuer Tether at $500 billion, making it one of the largest privately held companies in the world. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/341639/tether-investors-funding-round-softbank-ark-report))

- **Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin** says the network's upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for December, could put Ethereum on a path to becoming "truly mainstream" by solving several nettlesome scalability issues. ([CCN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vitalik-buterin-says-fusaka-could-094715641.html))

- **Richard Johnson, COO of Data Guardians Network,** advocates that web3 organiztions [integrate with web2 platforms](https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-rely-on-web2) rather than trying to replace them outright. The more collaborative approach would be better for public perception and user growth, which have otherwise been elusive for web3, Johnson says. Hmmm...

### Odds & Ends

- **Reframe, a Massachusetts-based construction startup,** is trying to seize America's current housing crunch as an opportunity to popularize modular assembly of factory-made homes. Such tech has long been a favorite of architects and other design nerds, but it has previously failed to gain wide adoption. In one Boston project, Reframe says it's taking a few days to assemble a three-story house that would likely take over a year to build using conventional processes. ([Slate](https://slate.com/business/2025/09/modular-housing-apartments-boston-reframe.html))

- **A new study suggests** that even a single exercise session could slow the growth of cancer cells. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/11/exercise-cancer-benefits-prevention-recurrence/))
