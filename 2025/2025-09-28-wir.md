### Week in Review: Sept. 21-27, 2025

- **Token prices tumbled** as traders [unwound leveraged positions](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560604990180). Worries about the U.S. economy and the expiration of listed options contracts Friday fueled the selloff. Bitcoin tumbled more than 5% to a new one-month low, and ether was off 10% for the week. Meanwhile, the most old-school financial safe haven of all benefited from traders' newly cautious mood: Gold jumped nearly 4%, nearing its first-ever close above [$4,000 per ounce](https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2025-09-24/4000-gold-real-possibility-literally-millions-ounces-still-be-purchased) in New York trading.

- **But over the longer term, crypto's performance still looks impressive.** Bitcoin is up more than 75% over the last 12 months, including a 16% gain in 2025 so far. Those gains have pushed the number of crypto millionaires up 40%, and crypto billionaires up 29% globally over the last 12 months, according to a [new report](https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/crypto-wealth-report-2025#contributors) by the consulting firm Henley & Partners.

- **Moodyâ€™s warned** that the rapid growth of crypto adoption in emerging markets â€” particularly for everyday use cases like savings and remittances â€” could undermine monetary sovereignty and weaken financial resilience. In particular, the report highlighted adoption of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar as a key concern, noting their potential to erode the effectiveness of domestic currencies and monetary policy. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/09/26/crypto-adoption-in-emerging-markets-poses-risks-to-financial-resilience-moody-s))

- **China's Securities Regulatory Commission** advised some brokerages in Hong Kong to pause tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) for clients. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/china-ask-brokers-pause-real-world-asset-business-hong-kong-sources-say-2025-09-23/))

- **The analytics firm Elliptic** said that leaked data from businesses controlled by Moldovan founder Ilan Shor shed new light on those companies' role in [facilitating Russian interference](https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-a7-leaks-the-role-of-crypto-in-russian-sanctions-evasion-and-election-interference) in Moldova's elections [this weekend](https://apnews.com/video/moldovans-head-to-polls-in-election-plagued-by-claims-of-russian-interference-219394cef2cf4d0bb1a89a92b2cb22d7). In particular, Elliptic says crypto wallets associated with Shor's company A7 have received $8 billion in stablecoin transactions over the past 18 months, much of it used to manage and pay a network of political activists in Moldova.

### Looking Ahead

- **SoftBank Group and Ark Invest** are reportedly in discussions to participate in a major funding round for Tether that would value the stablecoin issuer Tether at $500 billion, making it one of the largest privately held companies in the world. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/341639/tether-investors-funding-round-softbank-ark-report))

- **Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin** says the network's upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for December, could put Ethereum on a path to becoming "truly mainstream" by solving several nettlesome scalability issues. ([CCN](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vitalik-buterin-says-fusaka-could-094715641.html))

- **Richard Johnson, COO of Data Guardians Network,** advocates that web3 organiztions [integrate with web2 platforms](https://cointelegraph.com/news/web3-rely-on-web2) rather than trying to replace them outright. The more collaborative approach would be better for public perception and user growth, which have otherwise been elusive for web3, Johnson says. Hmmm...

### Odds & Ends

- **Reframe, a Massachusetts-based construction startup,** is trying to seize America's current housing crunch as an opportunity to popularize modular assembly of factory-made homes. Such tech has long been a favorite of architects and other design nerds, but it has previously failed to gain wide adoption. In one Boston project, Reframe says it's taking a few days to assemble a three-story house that would likely take over a year to build using conventional processes. ([Slate](https://slate.com/business/2025/09/modular-housing-apartments-boston-reframe.html))

- **A new study suggests** that even a single exercise session could slow the growth of cancer cells. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/11/exercise-cancer-benefits-prevention-recurrence/))
