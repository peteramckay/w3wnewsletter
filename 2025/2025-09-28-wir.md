### Odds & Ends

- **Basketball star and Coinbase investor Kevin Durant** has successfully regained access to a crypto wallet hosted by the exchange that he's been locked out of since 2016. At the time, he used the wallet to buy bitcoin around $650 per token. It's since risen 17,700%. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/20/kevin-durant-recovers-bitcoin-bought-at-usd650-now-up-over-17-700-after-nearly-a-decade))

- **A new study suggests** that even a single exercise session could slow the growth of cancer cells. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/11/exercise-cancer-benefits-prevention-recurrence/))
