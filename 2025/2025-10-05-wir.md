- After a summer of enthusiasm, corporate interest in stockpiling cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has cooled, with many companies seeing their shares drop and some trading below the value of their digital-asset holdings. The slowdown is attributed to an oversupply of crypto treasury companies and regulatory scrutiny, though some are exploring mergers and acquisitions to consolidate their positions. | The allure of cryptocurrencies is losing steam for some companies, as a glut of crypto treasury firms and increased regulatory scrutiny have led to a decline in their value and trading below their digital holdings. However, some firms are exploring consolidation through mergers and acquisitions to stay afloat in the shifting market.

### Looking Ahead

- Vanguard, the world's second-largest asset manager, is reportedly considering allowing its brokerage clients to access third-party cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a potential reversal of its previous stance against digital asset products. This shift comes in response to growing client demand for exposure to the crypto market, as well as changing regulatory dynamics that have made it easier for crypto ETFs to be approved. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/372531/vanguard-crypto-etf-access)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Claude Haiku -->

- Swedish lawmakers have proposed creating a national Bitcoin reserve, citing its potential to diversify state holdings and provide inflation protection. The proposal, which aims to position Sweden for a shift in the global financial infrastructure, comes as other countries, including the US, UK, and Kazakhstan, have also explored the idea of establishing strategic Bitcoin reserves.

- OKX founder Star Xu says the U.S. and U.K. are aligning on crypto oversight. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/29/the-u-s-and-u-k-are-aligning-on-blockchain-and-thats-good-for-the-world-economy/))
