### Week in Review: Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, 2025

- **Crypto treasury companies' shares** have [sagged lately](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-stockpiling-craze-cools-after-red-hot-summer-d1b6dce2?st=StdiWh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink), with many trading below the value of their token holdings. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission [suspended trading](https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-suspends-trading-of-qmmm-holdings-amid-crypto-treasury-manipulation-probe/) of QMMM Holdings over potential stock manipulation around its recent announcement of plans to buy bitcoin, ether, and Solana tokens.
- **America's anti-immigration push is reverberating globally in tech.** Reuters reports that Silicon Valley companies are weighing whether to [move more jobs offshore](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/silicon-valley-hiring-turmoil-after-new-h-1b-visa-fees-move-spurs-offshoring-2025-09-23/) after the White House announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, often used for software engineers and other high-skilled foreigners. Meanwhile, other countries are already angling to attract tech talent that might otherwise move to the U.S. China is launching a [new "K visa" program](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/chinas-new-k-visa-beckons-foreign-tech-talent-us-hikes-h-1b-fee-2025-09-29/) to attract such workers. And Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government is exploring ways to embrace America's H-1B fee hike [as an "opportunity"](https://www.cicnews.com/2025/09/canada-to-target-tech-talent-us-fee-hike-0960276.html) to attract tech workers to Canada instead.
- **The Wall Street Journal reports** Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is frustrated that implementation of a chips deal previously announced by the White House [has stalled](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/nvidia-trump-uae-chip-deal-delay-c49aaa5c?st=8hducg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). Under the agreement, the U.S. Commerce Department is supposed to allow Nvidia to export billions of dollars worth of AI chips to the United Arab Emirates.
-  **OpenAI closed a funding round valuing the company at $500 billion.** That makes it the most valuable privately held company in the world, surpassing SpaceX. ([Bloomberg](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-completes-share-sale-record-043148719.html))
- **California just passed a major AI safety law,** thus setting stricter standards for the crucial Silicon Valley region. The new law requires AI companies to report what safety protocols they use in developing their software and the risks posed by their products. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/technology/california-ai-safety-law.html))

### Looking Ahead

- **Wall Street giant Vanguard** is considering whether to allow clients to trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold bitcoin or other digital assets on investors' behalf. Vanguard, which is the world's second-largest asset manager, has been a notable holdout on offering crypto ETFs since Washington regulators approved them for U.S. trading in January 2024. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/372531/vanguard-crypto-etf-access))
- **Americans' access to crypto on their smartphones is improving.** Samsung announced it has [integrated Coinbase access](https://decrypt.co/342859/samsung-brings-coinbase-access-75m-wallet-users-latest-crypto-embrace) into the latest version of its mobile wallet app for U.S. users... Separately, the fintech startup OnePay, which is majority-owned by Walmart, said it will soon offer crypto trading and custody [through its mobile app](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/walmart-onepay-is-rolling-out-crypto-to-mobile-banking-app.html).
- **OKX founder Star Xu praised regulators** in Washington and London for their increasing alignment on oversight of digital assets. He says closer collaboration could help further entrench the U.S. and Britain as global finance centers versus aspiring hubs like Singapore and Dubai.

### Odds & Ends

- **Economist David Berri took a stab** at quantifying how underpaid WNBA players are compared to men in the NBA. While the men's league does bring in 50 times the revenue of the WNBA, its top players make 200 times the salaries of the WNBA's stars, Berri says. ([New York Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9kNjF0UFQ3NWt6d0JGelRRZzY3Mm9BN2ppbWZlbXRhUEpscndZTjl1bmprV2pmQU05NjZBeU41LU9DVjlCQnVORWl4ZmtTaERzMWdaQ1hnUHAwZ1FfaU1hZU9rd184TlhRVFpCSUJnN19RS1prdWxn?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))
- **Count web pioneer Dave Winer** among the folks who [still refer](http://scripting.com/2025/10/01/151233.html?title=weLikeTwitterSoBloggingMustBeDead) to a certain microblogging service as "Twitter." Glad I'm not the only one! ðŸ˜¸
