### Week in Review: Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, 2025

- **DAT shakeout:** After a summer of enthusiasm, corporate interest in stockpiling cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has cooled, with many companies seeing their shares drop and some trading below the value of their digital-asset holdings. The slowdown is attributed to an oversupply of crypto treasury companies and regulatory scrutiny, though some are exploring mergers and acquisitions to consolidate their positions. | The allure of cryptocurrencies is losing steam for some companies, as a glut of crypto treasury firms and increased regulatory scrutiny have led to a decline in their value and trading below their digital holdings. However, some firms are exploring consolidation through mergers and acquisitions to stay afloat in the shifting market. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-stockpiling-craze-cools-after-red-hot-summer-d1b6dce2?st=StdiWh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)) <!-- Draft news summaries by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has temporarily suspended trading of QMMM Holdings due to concerns over potential stock manipulation linked to the firm's pivot into cryptocurrency holdings. The suspension comes as part of a broader investigation into several companies over similar crypto-linked stock surges, highlighting the risks and potential pitfalls of crypto treasury strategies that have become increasingly popular among small-cap firms.

### Looking Ahead

- **Wall Street giant Vanguard** is considering whether to allow clients to trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold bitcoin or other digital assets on investors' behalf. Vanguard, which is the world's second-largest asset manager, has been a notable holdout on crypto ETFs since Washington regulators approved them for U.S. trading in January 2024. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/372531/vanguard-crypto-etf-access))
- **OKX founder Star Xu praised regulators** in Washington and London for their increasing alignment on oversight of digital assets. He says closer collaboration could help further entrench the U.S. and Britain as global finance centers versus aspiring hubs like Singapore and Dubai.

### Odds & Ends

- **Economist David Berri took a stab** at quantifying how underpaid WNBA players are compared to men in the NBA. While the men's league does bring in 50 times the revenue of the WNBA, its top players make 200 times the salaries of the WNBA's stars, Berri says.
