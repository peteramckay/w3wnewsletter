**Dr. Clayton Dalton explored a topic dear to my heart** in [a post](https://www.salon.com/2025/05/20/dont-fight-uncertainty--embrace-it/) for Salon on Tuesday. He writes:

>*It's hard to know what's real, it turns out.*
>
>*Sometimes things are obvious. When it‚Äôs raining, there‚Äôs no doubt about whether it‚Äôs raining or not. A flat tire, in all likelihood, really is a flat tire. But much of the world is not directly verifiable in this way. Are there really millions of dead people collecting Social Security? Does China secretly control the Panama Canal? Was that video on TikTok actually Tom Cruise? How do you know for sure?*
>
>*The rapid ascent of generative AI is only making things worse. Within the past few years, it‚Äôs been used to create political deepfakes from Moldova to South Africa to the United States. An AI-generated Imran Khan, Pakistan‚Äôs ex-prime minister, gave a speech while the real Khan was in jail. AI-generated evidence is now being introduced in divorce court, and last year AI was used to impersonate a company‚Äôs CFO and steal $25 million. According to one survey, deepfake incidents rose in 2024 by 300% in the United States, 1,625% in South Korea, 2,800% in China, and 3,000% in Bulgaria.*

For Dr. Dalton, an emergency room specialist, the solution to increasing AI-driven uncertainty isn't always to "solve" and replace it with certainty. He says it's often better to embrace the uncertainty, then use [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), a probability framework, to sort through a range of scenarios that *might* be true.

That strikes me as a highly useful prism through which to consider the latest blockbuster story about the AI industry itself: On Wednesday, [OpenAI acquired](https://decrypt.co/321363/apple-design-legend-jony-ive-joins-openai) legendary designer Jony Ive's startup io for $6.5 billion.

Cue the Silicon Valley hype machine, [vaporware](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vaporware), and borderline [messianic claims](https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/). The Wall Street Journal's Berber Jin [reports](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/what-sam-altman-told-openai-about-the-secret-device-hes-making-with-jony-ive-f1384005?st=jDCzRY&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) that Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have secretly been working on a potentially groundbreaking AI "companion" device that they plan to release by late next year.

According to the Journal, OpenAI is planning to quickly ship 100 million of the new gadget, with the goal of making it a "third device" for users alongside the daily staples of a laptop and smartphone.

So what are the chances that this new device will actually be such a megahit, and prove so indispensable to everyday users' daily routines, on such an accelerated timetable? How likely is it to be a "game changer," to borrow a common shorthand?

Let's do some back-of-the-envelope calculations, based on Ive's track record designing four Apple product lines that undeniably had their share of game-changing moments from the late 1990s through Ive's departure in 2019: the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

Let's assume that each of these lines had three truly game-changing product releases over that stretch, generation by generation of each device. So that comes out to 12 total.

Admittedly, the definition of what's "game-changing" is highly subjective. But I'm purposefully trying to give benefit of the doubt here, crediting Ive with a dozen truly groundbreaking, industry-changing products in his heyday at Apple. That averages out to about one every 18 months for Ive in the iDevice era ‚Äî an insanely prolific frequency of true "game changers" for any tech executive.

At the same time, let's acknowledge that not *every* iRelease under Ive was a groundbreaker. There were also some more modestly iterative products and, yes, some outright missteps. Remember the iPhone 4's [antenna issues](https://www.slashgear.com/842545/why-antennagate-was-a-complete-disaster-for-apple/)? Or that time Apple's obsession with making its devices thinner and lighter led to an iPhone 6 that was a bit [too bendy](https://qz.com/1288272/bendgate-was-real-apple-knew-the-iphone-6-was-very-bendy)?

(Thankfully, there was never actually an Apple Spatula. But the [spoof product video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WTE4QKDojg) for that one is still hilarious.)

According to the community-maintained [Apple Wiki](https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/), there were nine iMac generations, 26 generations of different iPod devices, 11 iPhone generations, and seven iPad generations through 2019, when Ive left Apple.

That comes out to a total 53 Ive-designed generations of iDevices. Divide that figure by our earlier estimate of 12 real game changers for him, and you have a 23% rate of breakthroughs.

That also means there is a 77% rate of non-breakthroughs, of course. I would offer that as a very rough estimate of the probability that the OpenAI device won‚Äôt be one either.‚Äù

### Five Things: May 18-24, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **Bitcoin set a new all-time high** near $112,000 per token [on Thursday](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-all-time-high-crypto-093320602.html). Prices have since retreated slightly, but there is no denying crypto remains in a renewed bull run for now, led by BTC. The original cryptocurrency has benefited recently from heavy institutional buying and increased investor appetite for havens aside from the dollar and [U.S. Treasury bonds](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-05-21-2025-f2e9c9cc?st=Frj82n&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)... Coincidentally, Thursday's new record price fell on Bitcoin Pizza Day, the anniversary of one of the earliest bitcoin transactions, in 2010. At the time, developer Laszlo Hanyecz [paid 10,000 BTC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2025/05/22/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-spent-more-bitcoin-than-you-think/) for two pizzas from Papa John's. Those tokens would now be worth over $1 billion.

- **President Trump hosted a controversial dinner** for the largest holders of his TRUMP memecoin at his golf club in Northern Virginia. The event has raised ethics questions around Washington, with the top 220 token holders collectively spending over $140 million to secure spots at the dinner. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/22/trump-meme-coin-dinner))

- **Hong Kong passed a stablecoin law** for issuers of fiat-pegged tokens, including requirements for licensing, reserve management, redemptions, and anti-money laundering controls. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/321516/hong-kong-passes-law-to-regulate-fiat-pegged-stablecoins))

- **Coinbase replaced Discover in the S&P 500,** marking [the first time](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-19/coinbase-becomes-first-crypto-company-to-join-the-s-p-500-after-rocky-week) a crypto platform has been included in the U.S. stock market's benchmark index... Separately, Coinbase [turned the tables](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/coinbase-puts-20-million-bounty-on-crooks-who-tried-to-extort-firm-over-stolen-customer-data/ar-AA1EORsm?ocid=TobArticle) on hackers demanding $20 million for the return of stolen user data. Instead, the exchange is offering the same sum for information leading to arrest and conviction of the hackers.

- **Solana Mobile plans to launch** a new token alongside its new crypto-oriented smartphone, due out Aug. 4. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/321360/why-solana-mobile-drop-token-seeker-phone))

| 10-yr U.S.<br> Treasury Yield | 4.5090% | +0.068 | -0.064 |


### Looking Ahead

- **The Commodity Futures Trading Commission,** which plays an important role in U.S. crypto oversight, is undergoing a major leadership transition. On Wednesday, Commissioner Kristin Johnson became the fourth member of the Washington agency's five-member board to [announce plans](https://www.theblock.co/post/355276/cftc-democratic-commissioner-kristin-johnson-plans-to-leave-marking-a-major-leadership-shakeup-at-the-agency) to leave, effective at year end. In addition, Commissioner Summer Mersinger is set to leave Friday [to lead the Blockchain Association](https://decrypt.co/319788/cftc-commissioner-mersinger-lead-crypto-lobbying-firm), an industry lobbying group. President Trump has nominated Brian Quintenz, who formerly led venture firm a16z's crypto policy team, to become the new CFTC chair. But there is no timetable yet for his Senate confirmation vote. Hmmmm...

- **Sesame Street is moving from Max to Netflix.** The new deal will also expedite distribution of free episodes of the venerable children's show via public broadcasting outlets in the U.S. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403663/sesame-street-netflix-pbs))

- **It is now possible to make insect cyborgs** for tasks like military reconnaissance or exploring dangerous caves or contaminated nuclear sites. But there are massive ethical gray areas. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/05/13/we-can-turn-bugs-into-flying-crawling-robocops-does-that-mean-we-should/))

### Odds & Ends

- **ICYMI:** a16z recently did a handy [podcast episode](https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/token-guide-crypto-JUFDm_Sn) about the basics of crypto tokens, different types, tokenomic models, and so on. A good resource for any crypto newbies about there looking for high-quality introductory info.

- **Many bank ATMs still run Windows XP** -- a version of Microsoft's famed operating system that the company officially stopped supporting in 2014. Yikes. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250516-the-people-stuck-using-ancient-windows-computers))
