### Five Things: May 18-24, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **Bitcoin set a new all-time high** near $112,000 per token [on Thursday](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-all-time-high-crypto-093320602.html). Prices have since retreated slightly, but there is no denying crypto remains in a renewed bull run for now, led by BTC. The original cryptocurrency has benefited recently from heavy institutional buying and increased investor appetite for havens aside from the dollar and [U.S. Treasury bonds](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-05-21-2025-f2e9c9cc?st=Frj82n&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)... Coincidentally, Thursday's new record price fell on Bitcoin Pizza Day, the anniversary of one of the earliest bitcoin transactions, in 2010. At the time, developer Laszlo Hanyecz [paid 10,000 BTC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/colinharper/2025/05/22/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-spent-more-bitcoin-than-you-think/) for two pizzas from Papa John's. Those tokens would now be worth over $1 billion.

- **Coinbase replaced Discover in the S&P 500.** The update marks [the first time](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-19/coinbase-becomes-first-crypto-company-to-join-the-s-p-500-after-rocky-week) a crypto platform has been included in the U.S. stock market's benchmark index... Separately, Coinbase [turned the tables](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/coinbase-puts-20-million-bounty-on-crooks-who-tried-to-extort-firm-over-stolen-customer-data/ar-AA1EORsm?ocid=TobArticle) on hackers demanding $20 million for the return of stolen user data. Instead, the exchange is offering the same sum for information leading to arrest and conviction of the hackers.

- US President Trump hosted an exclusive dinner for the largest holders of his meme coin, Official Trump, at his golf club in Virginia, sparking ethics concerns. The event has raised questions about the intersection of politics and cryptocurrency, with the top 220 holders reportedly spending over $140 million to secure a spot at the dinner. https://www.axios.com/2025/05/22/trump-meme-coin-dinner | A recent gala hosted by President Donald Trump for top buyers of his $TRUMP meme coin has raised concerns among lawmakers and regulators, threatening to derail stablecoin legislation. The event, which saw a 16% drop in the coin's value the next morning, has sparked protests and calls for a ban on presidents profiting from crypto ventures while in office, putting a bipartisan bill at risk of stalling. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/trump-meme-coin-dinner.html <!-- Draft summaries by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->

- Solana Mobile has unveiled plans to launch its own token, SKR, and introduce its decentralized architecture, TEEPIN, which will support its expansion to more hardware makers and decentralize its web3 ecosystem. The company also confirmed a shipping date of August 4 for its second crypto smartphone, "Seeker," which has already seen over 150,000 units presold across 57 countries. https://www.theblock.co/post/355238/solana-mobile-skr-token-seeker-shipping-date | Solana Mobile is set to launch a new token, SKR, to fuel its decentralized mobile ecosystem, which will be rooted in the layer-1 blockchain. The token will be used to coordinate growth and change within the ecosystem, and will be earned by builders and users for participation, with the goal of creating a decentralized mobile platform that is open to additional hardware manufacturers. https://decrypt.co/321360/why-solana-mobile-drop-token-seeker-phone <!-- Draft summaries by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->

- Hong Kong has passed a law requiring stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, aiming to balance innovation and investor protection in the city's growing digital asset market. The new law introduces a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, covering reserve asset management, redemption, and anti-money laundering controls, and is expected to come into effect later this year. https://decrypt.co/321516/hong-kong-passes-law-to-regulate-fiat-pegged-stablecoins <!-- Draft summaries by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->

### Looking Ahead

- **The Commodity Futures Trading Commission,** which plays an important role in U.S. crypto oversight, is undergoing a major leadership transition. On Wednesday, Commissioner Kristin Johnson became the fourth member of the Washington agency's five-member board to [announce plans](https://www.theblock.co/post/355276/cftc-democratic-commissioner-kristin-johnson-plans-to-leave-marking-a-major-leadership-shakeup-at-the-agency) to leave, effective at year end. In addition, Commissioner Summer Mersinger is set to leave Friday [to lead the Blockchain Association](https://decrypt.co/319788/cftc-commissioner-mersinger-lead-crypto-lobbying-firm), an industry lobbying group. President Trump has nominated Brian Quintenz, who formerly led venture firm a16z's crypto policy team, to become the new CFTC chair. But there is no timetable yet for his Senate confirmation vote. Hmmmm...

- **Sesame Street is moving from Max to Netflix.** The new deal will also expedite distribution of free episodes of the venerable children's show via public broadcasting outlets in the U.S. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403663/sesame-street-netflix-pbs))

- **It is now possible to make insect cyborgs** for tasks like military reconnaissance or exploring dangerous caves or contaminated nuclear sites. But there are massive ethical gray areas. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/05/13/we-can-turn-bugs-into-flying-crawling-robocops-does-that-mean-we-should/))

### Odds & Ends

- **ICYMI:** a16z recently did a handy [podcast episode](https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/token-guide-crypto-JUFDm_Sn) about the basics of crypto tokens, different types, tokenomic models, and so on. A good resource for any crypto newbies about there looking for high-quality introductory info.

- **Many bank ATMs still run Windows XP** -- a version of Microsoft's famed operating system that the company officially stopped supporting in 2014. Yikes. ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250516-the-people-stuck-using-ancient-windows-computers))
