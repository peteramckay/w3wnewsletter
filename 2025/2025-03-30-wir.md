**Remember when** [Very Serious People](https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/very-serious-question/) in Washington used to fret that encrypted messaging apps were *too* secure? Now they're suddenly not secure *enough*, following a bout of comically [boneheaded user error]() among chatty presidential advisers on Signal. <!-- -->

2. Encryption for me but not for thee.

3. Encryption will not protect systems or organizations from human error.

If you are oblivious enough to copy a magazine editor on the message string where you're planning to bomb a foreign country, no form of encryption or any other technology will save you. The solution is to be smarter and do better, full stop.

The same goes if you want to encrypt pictures of your kids or a conversation with your spouse or one with your boss or anything else.

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News.
