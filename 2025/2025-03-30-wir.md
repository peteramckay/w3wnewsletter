**Remember when** [Very Serious People](https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/very-serious-question/) in Washington used to fret that encrypted messaging apps were *too* secure? Now they're suddenly not secure *enough*, following a bout of comically [boneheaded user error](https://news.google.com/read/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNRGxtR3dRdS1NS0Qyc3R3RkZNSWdTQzJhTGpfV0tOaktUYjNMQnpBSmE4ckZIZzBWOEJTRFhvSTZlcUhfWV9hbVpXUzlBMjA5eFRYSk5zdzQxNE5qZlVGOHhFZ1V6UkNLb0hiRmdmRlQ5WW1tbW51U2toZ1BUZkwzTkNLSklTVEltbFRhWVMxWE9CZEZGcHZ6dU53a1drZXJhMDNucEw2NnVVLXl2?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) among chatty presidential advisers on Signal.

The serious political ramifications of the fiasco have been extensively covered elsewhere. For our purposes here, let it suffice that it's seldom a story of such magnitude about encryption commands this level of attention among non-geeks.

Between the lines, "Signalgate" also represents quite a new narrative about encryption since the last time many "normies" might have tuned in. Consider: 

- **In the years after 9/11,** the FBI often whinged that encrypted messaging apps were being used by terrorists to "go dark" while planning attacks, making law enforcement agencies' job more difficult. In particular, when James Comey was FBI director, [he lobbied](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1605439/fbi-director-calls-for-greater-police-access-to-communications-2.html) publicly and repeatedly for tech companies to build "back doors" into their encrypted devices and apps, supposedly for law enforcement's use only. This was largely how the product category was covered in the mainstream U.S. press for over a decade.

- **For its part,** the tech industry has always resisted building back doors, arguing that it works against the greater good for all users. Engineers say that any back door a tech company might build into its products at the behest of law enforcement [would inevitably be discovered](https://engineering.jhu.edu/magazine/2016/01/back-talk/) and exploited by other actors as well, thus jeopardizing *everyone's* privacy. In the wake of Signalgate, that argument looks all the wiser, no?

- **In December,** the FBI finally made a big flip-flop itself, [urging all Americans](https://www.pcmag.com/news/fbi-urges-americans-to-use-encryption-after-complaining-about-it-for-years) to use encrypted messaging to prevent attacks by Chinese hackers in particular. (So much for the threat of al-Qaeda and the like, I guess.) The bureau's reversal was not at all lost on tech reporters, though it seems a good bet that much of the audience probably didn't notice.  

- **In Senate testimony Tuesday,** CIA Director John Ratliffe said for the first time in public Signal comes installed on agency computers. Who knew! ([The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2025/03/25/signal-chat-encryption-hegseth-cia/))

- **But there are other technical considerations at play in Signalgate.** Remember, the controversey involves a group message string conducted via off-the-shelf mobile phones, not desktop PCs. Those phones could be subject to unique forms of malware or vulnerabilities in their operating systems or mobile networks. 

Finally, if there's a silver lining in Signalgate, it's perhaps that the crisis has spotlighted one person who unambiguously acted in the public's best interest and has been fully transparent: Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg.

He got off White House officials' Signal chat when he realized he'd been mistakenly included. In lieu of immediately taking to Twitter, he also waited to write about it and did additional reporting to gather more facts. 

That's a shining moment in journalism that shouldn't pass without comment, in my opinion. At a time when America's relationship with democracy is frankly going a bit wobbly, and when it's become disturbingly fashionable to slag on the press while getting your news from Uncle Moe on Facebook, here is a professional editor truly acting in the public interest.

Yes, it still happens. Probably more often than you think.

### Five Things: March 23-29, 2025

**I'm trying something a little different** with my news summary this time, in the spirit of "less is more." This list comprises just five recent stories about emerging tech that stood out to me as worth sharing with you:

- **Bitcoin is set to end the quarter in the red.** With a little over 24 hours left in 2025's first period, the token is [down about 7%](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bitcoin-close-q1-red-peaks-185459173.html) for the quarter. Worries about both U.S. growth and a possible resurgence in inflation have hampered bitcoin, stocks, and other risky assets recently. However, The Block's Brandon Kae and Ivan Wu note that bitcoin's share of the broader token market [hasn't flagged](https://www.theblock.co/post/348679/bitcoin-dominance-hits-58-as-alt-season-remains-elusive), recently hovering around 60%, as investors' appetite for altcoins hasn't picked up. Meanwhile, crypto trading volume has [plunged 70%](https://www.theblock.co/post/348685/crypto-trading-volumes-plunge-70-from-the-peak-as-post-election-hype-fades) from its peak as investors' euphoria following November's U.S. presidential election has faded.

- **But ether's price has fared even worse,** off more than 40% so far in 2025. Ethereum has largely [sat out](https://peteramckay.medium.com/a-twist-in-the-ethereum-solana-battle-59dfae42af81) the recent surge in memecoin activity, among other issues. The Financial Times' Philip Stafford says Ethereum is now suffering a full-blown ["midlife crisis,"](https://news.google.com/read/CBMicEFVX3lxTE50RVB3QW5JUnYxUzlGRVVZakl3ODZocjNGSnI0QkVCVVNBaFpNNFlNZVdvaDJMUlRGbXBBSFZzb2trQTZET1o5UjNTRUxxQzBxQnYxVVRZSkcwYmtwMmhmMWhNclhiU1dMNDJKVmJSZmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) lacking an investment narrative as cohesive as bitcoin's "digital gold" thesis.

- **The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,** a regulatory agency that has acted as a safety net for U.S. banking since the Great Depression, said the private-sector banks it supervises can now engage in crypto activities without seeking prior approval. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/312215/fdic-clears-path-for-bank-crypto-activities))

- **The genetic testing company 23andMe** filed for [Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection](https://apnews.com/article/23andme-chapter-11-bankruptcy-wojcicki-resigns-9827549d9171a537e76f60cb950d1823), raising concerns that the personal data of 15 million users may end up in the hands of a new, yet-to-be-determined buyer. California's attorney general issued a [consumer alert](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers) with instructions for deleting your data if you want to opt out of it being transferred in any potential company sale.

- **ICYMI:** The Bloomberg Originals documentary series did an excellent [episode about quantum computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_gJp2uAjO0&t=704s) in September. Just belatedly caught up on it myself, and I must say I've never experienced tech journalism making such a swing from mind-numbing to mind-bending in less than 30 minutes. ðŸ˜Š

### Odds & Ends

- **Photo archives are disappearing** at an alarming rate due to a complex mix of problems. Among the culprits: closures of struggling print publications, lack of digitization of old prints, and copyright considerations. ([Washington Post](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcjZQODVyZDFxeTg0QWNuMVB1ck54R3VMaWRZX2NTSkk3bWI4MjZMVFo2T0ZTZ0NtQkJVaXpSakRyRVNLbDZFRjc1UzRWOTdZSEo2LUFOSjRqQm5QSHhDb1IwUEo2NUtrSjNyZVJvNDJRYWNoV1JGM19DOU1fdEoyN1Q5R0c2QTdaeTFKc1E0bE1GMkFOaWZkbnpFUFpSTkpvYm1r?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **Sandwiches in New York** have become enormous. ([Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/sandwiches-in-nyc-have-become-enormous-and-too-big-to-eat-so-i-tried-some))
