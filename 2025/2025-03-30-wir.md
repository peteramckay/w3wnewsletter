2. Encryption for me but not for thee.

3. Encryption will not protect systems or organizations from human error.

If you are oblivious enough to copy a magazine editor on the message string where you're planning to bomb a foreign country, no form of encryption or any other technology will save you. The solution is to be smarter and do better, full stop.

The same goes if you want to encrypt pictures of your kids or a conversation with your spouse or one with your boss or anything else.

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News.
