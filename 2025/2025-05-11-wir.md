**Back in October 2023,** during what now seems like a quaintly milder political crisis in America, I wrote about [possible fallout](https://peteramckay.medium.com/yes-de-dollarization-is-a-real-risk-fd43f7954fd5) for the U.S. dollar as the global economy's reserve currency:

>*My hunch is that the rest of the world is warming to a key idea that bitcoiners like [author Saifedean Ammous] stress: Any government-issued fiat currency is inherently a political creation.*
>
>*Perhaps the rest of the world is witnessing America’s increasingly dysfunctional politics at home and recognizing them as an incentive to back away from the dollar. Maybe other countries don’t want to be so tied economically to our domestic messes anymore...*
>
>*To put it a different way, economists tend to model the world around the idea of rational people acting to maximize their returns. But in the world we actually live in, the U.S. political system is in fact increasingly irrational.*

At the time, Washington was suffering through a needless fight merely over who should be House speaker. Now we have something much worse -- a *president* waging an utterly bonkers trade war with most of the countries on the entire planet. (Except our besties Russia and North Korea, of course.)

### Five Things: April 27 to May 3, 2025

*The week's top headlines emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **President Trump's personal crypto dealmaking hurt the industry** politically at the U.S. capitol for the first time. The GENIUS ACT, which would set clearer rules for stablecoins, [failed to pass](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/senate-vote-stablecoint-crypto-genius-act) a procedural vote in the Senate by a 48-49 margin Thursday. Several members dropped support for the bill at the last minute, due mostly to growing bipartisan discomfort with Trump's [potential conflicts](https://www.yahoo.com/news/crypto-bill-faces-senate-pushback-182307355.html) around the [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) platform [World Liberty Financial](https://qz.com/trump-world-liberty-financial-corruption-meme-coin-1851779511) and his personal [TRUMP memecoin](https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-cryptocurrency-memecoin-top-holders-foreign-exchanges)... The Genius Act [could yet be revived](https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/05/10/state-of-crypto-mapping-out-the-senate-stablecoin-bills-next-steps), but it will have to survive a newly fraught political environment to do so... In the Senate, Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal formed a new subcommittee [to investigate](https://decrypt.co/318358/democratic-senator-investigates-trumps-chilling-crypto-ventures) whether Trump's crypto ventures are violating federal laws. In the House, New York Democrat Ritchie Torres is [proposing legislation](https://www.theblock.co/post/353501/rep-torres-to-introduce-bill-banning-trump-lawmakers-from-cashing-in-on-memecoins-and-stablecoins) that would bar lawmakers from profiting from similar crypto activity in the future.

- **OpenAI nixed its plan to convert to a for-profit entity.** Instead, it will remain under nonprofit governance while [restructuring](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-to-become-public-benefit-corporation-9e7896e0?st=QVaRQ6&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) its for-profit unit as a public-benefit corporation. CEO Sam Altman said the new approach will still allow OpenAI to access a $30 billion investment from SoftBank that was conditioned upon a successful restructuring... Separately, [OpenAI agreed to buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-reaches-agreement-buy-startup-000054157.html) the bot-assisted developer tool Windsurf for approximately $3 billion, its biggest acquistion to date. You know, just typical stuff that nonprofits do.

- **Ethereum activated its Pectra upgrade,** the network's [most significant iteration](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/05/07/ethereum-activates-pectra-upgrade-raising-max-stake-to-2048-eth) since the Merge in 2022. Pectra raises Ethereum's maximum staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ether tokens, along with other improvements in efficiency and wallet functionality. In a [blog post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/05/03/simplel1.html), Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he would like to see the platform become "simple as Bitcoin" by 2030.

- **Progress on crypto payments:** Coinbase revived a [long-forgotten payment feature](https://decrypt.co/318467/coinbase-breathes-new-lift-into-long-forgotten-web-payment-code) in the web's open HTTP standard. It could now be used to enable easier crypto payments on websites using minimal additional code and without user registration, emails, or complex signatures...
The protocol only uses a single line of code, simplifying how crypto could be used as a native payment on the web... Stripe unveiled [a new service](https://www.theblock.co/post/353605/stripe-unveils-new-stablecoin-feature-following-1-1-billion-bridge-acquisition) that allows businesses in 101 countries to receive stablecoin payments via either crypto or convential finance networks... And Visa made a [$50 million strategic investment](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/07/visa-doubles-down-on-stablecoins-with-investment-in-blockchain-payments-firm-bvnk) in the on-chain payments startup BVNK, signaling confidence in the future of crypto-based financial solutions.

- **Crypto exchanges on the move:** Coinbase acquired the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit [for $2.9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/coinbase-strikes-2-9-billion-deal-for-major-crypto-options-platform-a87ca4b3?st=PpmDxh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). But the San Francisco-based trading platform also posted [disappointing quarterly results](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-expects-lower-subscription-revenue-and-a-lot-more-went-wrong-for-the-crypto-exchange-3ebd9259), which it attributed to “broader market declines driven by tariff policy and macroeconomic uncertainty”... Meanwhile, rival eToro [filed with U.S. regulators](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/israels-etoro-targets-4-billion-valuation-us-ipo-2025-05-05) to do an initial public offering of stock at Nasdaq.  

### Looking Ahead

- **Meta may take a second stab at stablecoins.** Fortune's Leo Schwartz and Ben Weiss [report](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/05/08/meta-stablecoins-exploration-usdc-circle-diem-libra/) that the social giant is in talks with potential crypto partners to introduce stablecoins as a means to manage payments on Meta's platforms. If Meta pushes ahead with a new offering, it would represent a remarkable comeback from their failed Libra stablecoin project. That one launched to great fanfare in 2019, immediately drew heavy criticism and skepticism from regulators around the world, re-branded as Diem, and ultimately shut down without ever issuing a single token.

- **The Salvadoran news outlet El Faro** said on Monday that President Nayib Bukele's government is [preparing to arrest](https://beta.elfaro.net/en/el-salvador-en/el-faro-denounces-possible-arrest-warrants-for-at-least-seven-staff-members-in-el-salvador) several of its staff members to silence their reporting on the nation's criminal gangs. As of Friday, it doesn't seem there have in fact been any arrests. But it will be worth keeping an eye on this situation for those of us in America and beyond, as Bukele has grown [increasingly close](https://elfaro.net/en/202515/el_salvador/27826/El-Faro-Denounces-Possible-Arrest-Warrants-for-At-Least-Seven-Staff-Members-in-El-Salvador.htm) to President Trump politically. He has also been a darling of the bitcoin community for experimenting with the token [as legal tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador) in El Salvador beginning in 2021.  

### Odds & Ends

- **Stop calling them ink-stained.** Nearly 95% of the New York Times' 11.66 million subscribers in the first quarter were digital-only customers, according to the publisher's latest [earnings report](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2025/05/Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-Final-For-Distribution-EkMinJ5V.pdf), released Wednesday.

- **Being polite to AI chatbots is pointless,** according to new research by a team from George Washington University. But some skeptics say the latest study's methodology was too narrow to capture the broader impact of saying "please" and "thank you" to elicit higher-quality responses from some large-language models.
