- **Being polite to ChatGPT is pointless.** The Decrypt article titled "Being Polite to ChatGPT is Pointless New Research Shows" discusses a new study by George Washington University researchers indicating that using polite words like "please" and "thank you" has a *negligible effect on AI response quality* for models like ChatGPT, contrary to earlier findings. The research suggests that the "Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point" where AI outputs degrade depends on training and substantive prompt words, not courtesy, and relates to the model spreading its attention too thinly over longer responses.
