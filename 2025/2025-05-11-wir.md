If you have conferences, award competitions, or similar time-sensitive stuff in the works, this is a place I'd like to share such info in future updates. Please email me the details at peter[at]w3w[dot]media. ðŸ“¬ -->


### Odds & Ends

- **Being polite to ChatGPT is pointless.** <!-- Earlier summary drafted by NotebookLM --> The Decrypt article titled "Being Polite to ChatGPT is Pointless New Research Shows" discusses a new study by George Washington University researchers indicating that using polite words like "please" and "thank you" has a *negligible effect on AI response quality* for models like ChatGPT, contrary to earlier findings. The research suggests that the "Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point" where AI outputs degrade depends on training and substantive prompt words, not courtesy, and relates to the model spreading its attention too thinly over longer responses.
