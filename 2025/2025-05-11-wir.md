**Don't be fooled.**

Yes, markets have calmed since an initial shock from President Donald J. Trump's major tariff announcement on April 2, which he incongruously dubbed "Liberation Day." Now bitcoin is [within reach of a new record](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-holds-strong-above-100k-new-record-ahead-or-brewing-pullback-125050900712_1.html), and the S&P 500 has [almost recovered](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-stocks-have-rallied-furiously-since-their-liberation-day-losses-2025-5?op=1) to its pre-Liberation Day level heading into Monday's open on Wall Street.

But major long-term risks remain on inflation, growth, and America's role as the linchpin of the global financial system. For an accessible discussion of that bigger picture, check out New York Times columnist Ezra Klein's [recent podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT2cohNt6a4&t=958s) with Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.

The professor has [a new book](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Dollar-Your-Problem-Turbulent/dp/0300275315/ref=sr_1_2?sr=8-2) out about the U.S. dollar's role as the world's reserve currency, which he sees as freshly in play because of Trump. In his chat with Klein, Rogoff says  the current president's chaotic trade policy poses the biggest risk to the dollar's global role since Nixon ended its peg to gold [in 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock).

Since Liberation Day, it's notable that the greenback has not recovered quite as quickly as stocks. The [U.S. Dollar Index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB/?p=DX-Y.NYB&.tsrc=fin-srch), which measures the currency's strength versus a basket of foreign denominations, is still down more than 3%. And [gold](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC%3DF/?p=GC%253DF), a traditional haven during economic turbulence, is still near its all-time high [set last month](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/volatility-in-the-stock-market-leads-to-soaring-gold-prices/).

Then there's that surge in bitcoin, which its fans often say could replace the dollar as the global economy's standard. Honestly, my hunch is that the recent gains are mostly a renewed round of speculation. Nothing more -- for now.

But if the token sees a more sustained rally over time, coupled with what I believe has already been a long-term [trend toward dysfunction](https://peteramckay.medium.com/yes-de-dollarization-is-a-real-risk-fd43f7954fd5) in the U.S. political system that undermines the dollar, let's check back.

### Five Things: April 27 to May 3, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **President Trump's personal crypto dealmaking hurt the industry** politically at the U.S. capitol for the first time. The GENIUS ACT, which would set clearer rules for stablecoins, [failed to pass](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/senate-vote-stablecoint-crypto-genius-act) a procedural vote in the Senate by a 48-49 margin Thursday. Several members dropped support for the bill at the last minute, due mostly to growing bipartisan discomfort with Trump's [potential conflicts](https://www.yahoo.com/news/crypto-bill-faces-senate-pushback-182307355.html) around the [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) platform [World Liberty Financial](https://qz.com/trump-world-liberty-financial-corruption-meme-coin-1851779511) and his personal [TRUMP memecoin](https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-cryptocurrency-memecoin-top-holders-foreign-exchanges)... The Genius Act [could yet be revived](https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2025/05/10/state-of-crypto-mapping-out-the-senate-stablecoin-bills-next-steps), but it will have to survive a newly fraught political environment to do so... In the Senate, Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal formed a new subcommittee [to investigate](https://decrypt.co/318358/democratic-senator-investigates-trumps-chilling-crypto-ventures) whether Trump's crypto ventures are violating federal laws. In the House, New York Democrat Ritchie Torres is [proposing legislation](https://www.theblock.co/post/353501/rep-torres-to-introduce-bill-banning-trump-lawmakers-from-cashing-in-on-memecoins-and-stablecoins) that would bar lawmakers from profiting from similar crypto activity in the future.

- **OpenAI nixed its plan to convert to a for-profit entity.** Instead, it will remain under nonprofit governance while [restructuring](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-to-become-public-benefit-corporation-9e7896e0?st=QVaRQ6&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) its for-profit unit as a public-benefit corporation. CEO Sam Altman said the new approach will still allow OpenAI to access a $30 billion investment from SoftBank that was conditioned upon a successful restructuring... Separately, [OpenAI agreed to buy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-reaches-agreement-buy-startup-000054157.html) the bot-assisted developer tool Windsurf for approximately $3 billion, its biggest acquistion to date. You know, just typical stuff that nonprofits do.

- **Ethereum activated its Pectra upgrade,** the network's [most significant iteration](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/05/07/ethereum-activates-pectra-upgrade-raising-max-stake-to-2048-eth) since the Merge in 2022. Pectra raises Ethereum's maximum staking limit from 32 to 2,048 ether tokens, along with other improvements in efficiency and wallet functionality. In a [blog post](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/05/03/simplel1.html), Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he would like to see the platform become "simple as Bitcoin" by 2030.

- **Progress on crypto payments:** Coinbase revived a [long-forgotten payment feature](https://decrypt.co/318467/coinbase-breathes-new-lift-into-long-forgotten-web-payment-code) in the web's open HTTP standard. It could now be used to enable easier crypto payments on websites using minimal additional code and without user registration, emails, or complex signatures...
The protocol only uses a single line of code, simplifying how crypto could be used as a native payment on the web... Stripe unveiled [a new service](https://www.theblock.co/post/353605/stripe-unveils-new-stablecoin-feature-following-1-1-billion-bridge-acquisition) that allows businesses in 101 countries to receive stablecoin payments via either crypto or convential finance networks... And Visa made a [$50 million strategic investment](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/05/07/visa-doubles-down-on-stablecoins-with-investment-in-blockchain-payments-firm-bvnk) in the on-chain payments startup BVNK, signaling confidence in the future of crypto-based financial solutions.

- **Crypto exchanges on the move:** Coinbase acquired the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit [for $2.9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/coinbase-strikes-2-9-billion-deal-for-major-crypto-options-platform-a87ca4b3?st=PpmDxh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). But the San Francisco-based trading platform also posted [disappointing quarterly results](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-expects-lower-subscription-revenue-and-a-lot-more-went-wrong-for-the-crypto-exchange-3ebd9259), which it attributed to ‚Äúbroader market declines driven by tariff policy and macroeconomic uncertainty‚Äù... Meanwhile, rival eToro [filed with U.S. regulators](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/israels-etoro-targets-4-billion-valuation-us-ipo-2025-05-05) to do an initial public offering of stock at Nasdaq.  

### Looking Ahead

- **Meta may take a second stab at stablecoins.** Fortune's Leo Schwartz and Ben Weiss [report](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/05/08/meta-stablecoins-exploration-usdc-circle-diem-libra/) that the social giant is in talks with potential crypto partners to introduce stablecoins as a means to manage payments on Meta's platforms. If Meta pushes ahead with a new offering, it would represent a remarkable comeback from their failed Libra stablecoin project. That one launched to great fanfare in 2019, immediately drew heavy criticism and skepticism from regulators around the world, re-branded as Diem, and ultimately shut down without ever issuing a single token.

- **The Salvadoran news outlet El Faro** said on Monday that President Nayib Bukele's government is [preparing to arrest](https://beta.elfaro.net/en/el-salvador-en/el-faro-denounces-possible-arrest-warrants-for-at-least-seven-staff-members-in-el-salvador) several of its staff members to silence their reporting on the nation's criminal gangs. As of Friday, it doesn't seem there have in fact been any arrests. But it will be worth keeping an eye on this situation for those of us in America and beyond, as Bukele has grown [increasingly close](https://elfaro.net/en/202515/el_salvador/27826/El-Faro-Denounces-Possible-Arrest-Warrants-for-At-Least-Seven-Staff-Members-in-El-Salvador.htm) to President Trump politically. He has also been a darling of the bitcoin community for experimenting with the token [as legal tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador) in El Salvador beginning in 2021.  

### Odds & Ends

- **Stop calling them ink-stained.** Nearly 95% of the New York Times' 11.66 million subscribers in the first quarter were digital-only customers, according to the publisher's latest [earnings report](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2025/05/Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-Final-For-Distribution-EkMinJ5V.pdf), released Wednesday.

- **Being polite to AI chatbots is pointless,** according to new research by a team from George Washington University. But some skeptics say the latest study's methodology was too narrow to capture the broader impact of saying "please" and "thank you" to elicit higher-quality responses from some large-language models.
