### Five Things: April 27 to May 3, 2025

*The week's top headlines emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **President Trump's personal crypto dealmaking hurt the industry** politically at the U.S. capitol for the first time. The GENIUS ACT, which would set clearer rules for stablecoins, [failed to pass](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/senate-vote-stablecoint-crypto-genius-act) a procedural vote in the Senate by a 48-49 margin Thursday. Several members dropped support for the bill at the last minute, due mostly to growing bipartisan discomfort with Trump's [potential conflicts](https://www.yahoo.com/news/crypto-bill-faces-senate-pushback-182307355.html) around the [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) platform [World Liberty Financial](https://qz.com/trump-world-liberty-financial-corruption-meme-coin-1851779511) and his personal [TRUMP memecoin](https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-cryptocurrency-memecoin-top-holders-foreign-exchanges)... The Genius Act [could yet be revived](https://gizmodo.com/crypto-friendly-genius-act-fails-key-senate-vote-as-dems-defect-2000599844), but it will have to survive a newly fraught political environment to do so... In the Senate, Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal formed a new subcommittee [to investigate](https://decrypt.co/318358/democratic-senator-investigates-trumps-chilling-crypto-ventures) whether Trump's crypto ventures are violating federal laws. In the House, New York Democrat Ritchie Torres is [proposing legislation](https://www.theblock.co/post/353501/rep-torres-to-introduce-bill-banning-trump-lawmakers-from-cashing-in-on-memecoins-and-stablecoins) that would bar lawmakers from profiting from similar crypto activity in the future.

- **Crypto exchanges on the move:** Coinbase acquired the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit [for $2.9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/coinbase-strikes-2-9-billion-deal-for-major-crypto-options-platform-a87ca4b3?st=PpmDxh&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). But the San Francisco-based trading platform also posted [disappointing quarterly results](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coinbase-expects-lower-subscription-revenue-and-a-lot-more-went-wrong-for-the-crypto-exchange-3ebd9259), which it attributed to ‚Äúbroader market declines driven by tariff policy and macroeconomic uncertainty‚Äù... Meanwhile, rival eToro [filed with U.S. regulators](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/israels-etoro-targets-4-billion-valuation-us-ipo-2025-05-05) to do an initial public offering of stock at Nasdaq.

- **OpenAI updates:** OpenAI decided to abandon its plan to become a for-profit entity, opting to remain under nonprofit governance while restructuring its for-profit subsidiary as a public-benefit corporation.

### Looking Ahead

<!--

- **Meta may take a second stab at stablecoins.** https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/05/08/meta-stablecoins-exploration-usdc-circle-diem-libra/

<!--

- The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) clarified that banks can manage cryptocurrency assets for customers and are permitted to outsource related services, provided they maintain proper oversight and adhere to regulatory standards. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/318478/occ-says-banks-can-handle-crypto-for-customers-and-outsource-it-too)) <!-- Draft summary by ChatGPT

-->

- **The Salvadoran news outlet El Faro** said on Monday that President Nayib Bukele's government is [preparing to arrest](https://beta.elfaro.net/en/el-salvador-en/el-faro-denounces-possible-arrest-warrants-for-at-least-seven-staff-members-in-el-salvador) several of its staff members to silence their reporting on the nation's criminal gangs. As of Friday, it doesn't seem there have in fact been any arrests. But it will be worth keeping an eye on this situation for those of us in America and beyond, as Bukele has grown [increasingly close](https://elfaro.net/en/202515/el_salvador/27826/El-Faro-Denounces-Possible-Arrest-Warrants-for-At-Least-Seven-Staff-Members-in-El-Salvador.htm) to President Trump politically. He has also been a darling of the bitcoin community for experimenting with the token [as legal tender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador) in El Salvador beginning in 2021.  

### Odds & Ends

- **Stop calling them ink-stained.** Nearly 95% of the New York Times' 11.66 million subscribers in the first quarter were digital-only customers, according to the publisher's latest [earnings report](https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2025/05/Q1-2025-Earnings-Release-Final-For-Distribution-EkMinJ5V.pdf), released Wednesday.

- **Being polite to AI chatbots is pointless,** according to new research by a team from George Washington University. But some skeptics say the latest study's methodology was too narrow to capture the broader impact of saying "please" and "thank you" to elicit higher-quality responses from some large-language models.
