<!-- Blog re: content strategy for '26. Should run ~300 words -->

**Like a lot of people these days,** I'm sick to death of corporate social platforms. In that spirit, this will be my last regular update of w3w via Substack. In effect, I'll also be retiring the w3w brand in general. <!-- Could use a link here to a news story about declining public faith in the Big Tech platforms. -->

But fear not: I will continue to write about emerging tech (and sometimes other topics as well) via my self-hosted personal blog. And that site will maintain its own email distribution list as well, starting Jan. 30.

So if you want to keep getting updates like this from me via your inbox, just hang tight. By default, I will include all w3w's Substack subcribers as of Jan. 30 on the new email distribution list. Thus we can continue our conversation about tech into 2026 and beyond.

To be honest, w3w was always basically a one-man show anyway. So I figure this approach will make sense for most subscribers.

That said, I also want to be transparent about moving people's email addresses from one service to another. If you don't want to be included on my post-Substack distribution list, there are two ways to opt out:

- Unsubscribe from w3w on Substack before Jan. 30. Or...

- Drop me a direct message via email at peter[at]pmckay[dot]come, and I will remove you manually. (This is also a good option if you have questions or comments you want to pass along.)

Other notes, etc...

I'm taking this year-end period as an opportunity to reassess which ones are still truly useful for me and which ones I could really do without.

I figure this will help me minimize exposure to the nastier aspects of corporate platforms, but still maintain a community, etc.

Stricter POSSE approach.

### Week in Review: Dec. 14-20, 2025

- **Stablecoins:** FDIC proposes new stablecoins rules. ([]()) <!-- Link TK --> | Gold-backed stablecoins are booming.

- The Federal Reserve is seeking public feedback on a proposed "payment account" or "skinny master account" that would grant certain institutions, potentially including crypto-related firms, limited access to the central bank's payment services. This account would allow eligible institutions to clear and settle payments without the full privileges of a traditional master account, while keeping the payments system safe. Comments on the proposal are due in 45 days. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/383343/fed-seeks-public-input-on-skinny-master-account-for-limited-access-to-the-central-bank)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- The SEC is seeking to bar former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and former FTX executives Gary Wang and Nishad Singh from being directors or officers of public companies for several years. Ellison agreed to a 10-year ban, while Wang and Singh agreed to an 8-year ban, as part of a proposed consent judgment related to their roles in the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research. The SEC previously charged the three executives with defrauding investors and reached a settlement.

- Google has been aggressively rehiring former employees, with 20% of its AI software engineers hired in 2025 being so-called "boomerang employees." This trend is part of the company's efforts to compete for AI talent, which has been heating up between companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic. Google's deep pockets and computational infrastructure are major draws for AI-focused software engineers. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/19/google-boomerang-year-20percent-ai-software-devs-hired-2025-ex-employees.html)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

### Looking Ahead

- **Mixed news for crypto in the U.S. Senate.** The Senate's crypto market structure bill, known as the Clarity Act, is set for a January markup, moving the landmark legislation closer to a floor vote. The bill aims to establish a comprehensive federal framework for digital assets by defining regulatory jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. However, Democratic concerns over regulatory independence and potential presidential power to appoint and remove agency commissioners may impact the bill's passage. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/352981/senators-set-january-markup-for-crypto-market-structure-bill)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a strong ally to the crypto industry in Washington, has announced she will not seek reelection when her term expires next year. Lummis, often referred to as the "Bitcoin Senator," has been instrumental in passing industry-favored legislation, including the GENIUS Act, which established a federal framework for stablecoins. Her retirement will likely impact ongoing negotiations over the crypto industry's coveted market structure bill.

- Mizuho says Coinbase could cannibalize its core crypto business by launching a predictions market. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/352554/coinbase-risks-crypto-cannibalization-prediction-market-push-mizuho)) |

- Coinbase has filed federal lawsuits in three states, including Illinois, to challenge state attempts to block prediction markets, arguing that they fall under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's authority rather than individual state gaming boards. The lawsuits come as Coinbase prepares to launch prediction markets in January 2026 through a partnership with Kalshi, a CFTC-registered designated contract market. This move is seen as a significant validation of the prediction market industry, with some experts predicting a shift from a duopoly to a more competitive market in 2026.
