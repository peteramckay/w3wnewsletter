<!-- Riff on Trump/Intel brouhaha. Some useful links from WSJ: -->

- Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is facing pressure from the company's board and a surprise attack from former President Trump, who has called for Tan's ouster citing "conflict" due to his business ties to China. The tensions come as Tan has been at odds with the board over strategies to revive the tech giant, including whether to stay in the manufacturing business and how to invest in artificial intelligence. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-trump-board-9cc08631?st=KUDbuC&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))<!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, brings a wealth of experience to the role, having previously led Cadence Design Systems and founded Walden International, a venture capital firm with ties to China. Tan's appointment comes as Intel faces challenges in the industry, with some speculating that the company may break up its manufacturing and product businesses.

- Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is facing scrutiny over his ties to China, particularly his past involvement with companies that sold technology to Chinese state-controlled research institutions, including one accused of developing military systems. Tan has maintained that he has operated within the highest legal and ethical standards, but his company has received criticism from U.S. officials and lawmakers, who are concerned about the potential risks of China's use of American technology for military purposes.

- Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan's venture-capital firm, Walden International, has been at the center of controversy due to its investments in China's chip industry, with some Republicans questioning how Tan advanced China's technology ambitions. Tan has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he shares the president's commitment to U.S. national and economic security, and has been working with the administration to address concerns.

### Five Things: Aug. 3-9, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **OpenAI released GPT-5,** a highly anticipated update to the language model that powers its popular ChatGPT app. CEO Sam Altman described the latest version as a "significant step along our path" to a creating more human-like artificial general intelligence. But OpenAI's promotion of GPT-5 has focused so far on its usability improvements, not computational breakthroughs. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/gpt5-openai-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-d12cd2d6310a2515042067b5d3965aa1))

- **Ether's price hit $4,000 on Friday** for the first time in 2025. The token's rally has been fueled by hopes for a boom in stablecoin issuance on the Ethereum blockchain following the recent passage of clearer rules for that category in the U.S. ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-just-hit-4-000-144720193.html))

- **The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs have jointly dismissed their respective appeals in a nearly five-year-long lawsuit over XRP, effectively ending the high-profile case. This move brings finality to the litigation and leaves prior court findings in place, potentially paving the way for new regulatory approaches to other cryptocurrencies. ([The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/news/regulation/sec-ripple-end-five-year-xrp-lawsuit-joint-appeal-dismissal-28d1a73c)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Coinbase has launched a decentralized exchange (DEX) integration, allowing users to trade millions of digital assets within the Coinbase app without leaving it. This move comes as the company aims to position itself as an "everything exchange" and follows a decline in spot trading volumes and revenue for the second quarter. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/366198/coinbase-launches-dex-trading-for-us-users-amid-volume-decline)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Harvard University has invested a significant amount in Bitcoin through BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, with $117 million worth of shares at the end of the second quarter. This investment ranks as the university's fifth largest investment, surpassing its holdings in Alphabet, Google's parent company, with nearly $114 million worth of shares. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/366224/harvard-had-more-money-in-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-than-google-shares-at-end-of-last-quarter)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

### Looking Ahead

- **A federal judge in San Francisco ruled** that AI company Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its chatbot Claude constitutes "fair use" under U.S. copyright law. But the company still faces trial over how it acquired those books. The case represents a high-profile test for creators who want to be compensated for their works' use in training AI models. ([Associated Press](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/judge-rules-ai-company-anthropic-didnt-break-copyright-law-but-must-face-trial-over-pirated-books/ar-AA1Hl1VN?ocid=BingNewsVerp&apiversion=v2&noservercache=1&domshim=1&renderwebcomponents=1&wcseo=1&batchservertelemetry=1&noservertelemetry=1)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- **Cointelegraphâ€™s Savannah Fortis** recently spoke with two executives on her podcast about their work building corporate crypto treasuries. If you're looking for a good 20-minute overview of that trend, including examples of specific implementations, I would definitely recommend checking out [the episode](https://cointelegraph.com/news/behind-the-scenes-of-public-companies-that-are-rushing-to-create-crypto-treasuries).  

- **Pollster Patrick Ruffini** says Apple's upcoming iOS 26 update could significantly set back public opinion research in the U.S. by segregating texts from unknown senders. The change would make it harder for pollsters to reach voters with questions about their views on specific political issues and candidates, Ruffini says. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/07/apple-ios-update-spam-polling-democracy/))

### Odds & Ends

- **A group of Native American teens completed** what is believed to be the first full descent of the Pacific Coast's Klamath River. The U.S. government recently finished removing four decades-old dams from the waterway, which tribal elders regard as sacred. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2025/klamath-river-kayak-journey/))

- **A spokesman for the group** behind Green Dildo Coin, an obscure meme token, took credit for recent incidents in which sex toys were thrown onto the court during WNBA games. The group claims it's trying to attract publicity to raise awareness about protections (or lack thereof) for small crypto investors. Exactly WTF that issue has to do with the WNBA is unclear, however. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sports/wnba-sex-toy-incidents-linked-cryptocurrency-group-2025-08-07/))
