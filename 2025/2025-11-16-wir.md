**Lead item goes here.** Yadda yadda yadda. <!-- Followup on BTC vs gold -->

- The Czech central bank just bout $1M in BTC, becoming first central bank to hold the token. https://www.reuters.com/business/czech-central-bank-buys-1-mln-bitcoin-other-crypto-assets-testing-2025-11-13/ <!-- PM -->

- At a Yahoo Finance event on Thursday, Strategy founder Michael Saylor [predicted](https://markets.financialcontent.com/wral/article/breakingcrypto-2025-11-14-michael-saylor-bitcoin-to-eclipse-gold-by-2035-but-market-reacts-with-caution) that bitcoin will surpass gold's market capitalization by 2035.  <!-- PM -->

- **Bitcoin Price Drops Below $100,000 to Lowest Level Since May** Bitcoin's price plunged sharply this week, falling below the $100,000 mark—a psychological barrier not breached since early Q2. Analysts attribute the volatility to a mix of bearish macroeconomic news, persistent outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the continuing regulatory uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. market structure legislation in the Senate.

### Week in Review: Nov. 9-15, 2025

- **Yikes.** Anthropic said it discovered an AI-generated cyberattack from China targeting at least 30 organizations. This marks the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human input. ([TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/anthropic-claims-chinese-hackers-hijacked-claude-to-launch-ai-orchestrated-and-automated-cyberattacks)) <!-- Google Gemini -->

- **Ripple said it has raised $500 million** in a new venture investment round that values the company at $40 billion in full. The company, whose XRP token is currently the world's fourth-largest by market capitalization, has been pushing into new lines of business recently, including crypto custody and prime brokerage. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/05/ripple-gets-40-billion-valuation-after-500-million-funding-round.html)) <!-- PM -->

- **Renowned shortseller Jim Chanos** said he has unwound what appears to be a highly profitable bearish bet on Strategy, spurred by his skepticism that its shares were trading at too high a premium to its bitcoin holdings. The move comes at a time when Wall Street has generally grown wary of so-called crypto treasury companies. ([Financial Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMicEFVX3lxTE1SNXBPMUJLNGdCbW11RjE2NkFPWWEyUDFkZnRfQmx4bkpCdXVONzc4SjlLdC03Sk43cjNfSXlGTzM4cENLbWlOZTJvY3ZBNno1dDhYd0hELVU0NUQyaVphXzdraENMdGxRTUZOekVwZ2M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)) <!-- PM -->

- **OpenAI asked a federal judge in New York** to reverse a recent court order to turn over 20 million anonymized ChatGPT chat logs in a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by the New York Times and other news outlets, citing concerns that it would expose users' private conversations. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/openai-fights-order-turn-over-millions-chatgpt-conversations-2025-11-12/)) <!-- PM -->

- **Microsoft's vague public disclosures regarding its financial relationship with OpenAI** are making Wall Street Journal accounting reporter Jonathan Weil's head hurt. That's my educated guess, at least, speaking as Jon's former cubicle mate after reading his latest, [characteristically thorough story](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-dealings-with-openai-still-need-a-lot-more-sunlight-f001cb19?st=jcE2Q4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) on the topic. 😂 <!-- PM -->

### Looking Ahead

- **The Senate Agriculture Committee released** its initial draft of a bill to broadly restructure regulation of crypto markets in the U.S. The draft, which follows a comprehensive stablecoin law passed earlier this year, seeks to clarify the roles of different federal agencies in overseeing crypto trading. It also would create new rules to mitigate conflicts of interest in the industry. ([CoinGeek](https://coingeek.com/us-senate-ag-committee-releases-market-structure-draft/)) <!-- Google Gemini -->

- **Apple will pay Google approximately $1 billion a year** to access the search giant’s AI technology to power its Siri voice assistant. The deal highlights Apple's lag in developing AI tools of its own compared to other Silicon Valley hegemons. ([CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-to-reportedly-pay-google-1-billion-a-year-for-siris-custom-gemini-ai-model/)) <!-- Google Gemini -->

- **Moonshot AI,** a Beijing-based startup, says its K2 language model outperformed both OpenAI's GPT-5 and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 in early testing entailing complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. The announcement underscores China's growing competition with America's major AI players.

### Odds & Ends

- **"Moonlighting" is so 1988.** The modern term you're looking for is ["polyworking,"](https://ca.style.yahoo.com/workers-side-jobs-combat-stagnant-150315633.html) says the AP's Cathy Bussewitz. <!-- Me -->

- **Good to know!** Researchers at the University of British Columbia have published a study claiming to have mathematically proven that the universe is real, not a simulation. ([Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a69239099/not-in-a-simulation/)) <!-- Me -->
