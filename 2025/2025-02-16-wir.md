**One rule of thumb I use when curating links** for this newsletter is to highight events in tech that have *actually happened*, with consequences that are already tangible in some way. I tend to skip altogether stories that only predict or speculate about things to come.

Obvious as that may sound to any journalist, it pays to be extra, extra vigilant about such a simple distinction regarding tech news in particular. The subject matter naturally invites *a lot* of idle prediction and speculation, sometimes called [vaporware](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vaporware) by people within the tech industry.

That said, I have to admit there is a narrow sub-category of opinion or speculative content that does have real value. This usually happens either because the idea is soooo extraordinarily compelling or (more often in my estimation) because of *who* is putting it forward.

In that vain -- and for a change of pace around here -- a couple of articles that have caught my attention lately:

- **U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand** took to CoinDesk's pages to [tout the GENIUS Act](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/10/why-we-need-a-bipartisan-stablecoin-bill), a stablecoin bill that the New York Democrat recently co-sponsored. The proposal lays out a framework for stablecoin regulation in America -- obviously an important issue for crypto investors. Plus it's interesting to read Gillibrand's arguments as a possible signal of the changing politics around crypto in Washington. Perhaps national Democrats, who took a drubbing on crypto issues in November's election, are getting more assertive about carving out space for themselves with voters who care about such stuff.

- **Investment manager Jan van Eck,** whose company offers a popular exchange-traded funds on bitcoin, offered his ideas for protecting crypto investors in a [Washington Post op-ed](https://news.google.com/read/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPcnFWaGt3bmh5dk1JcEdKWTBtaEZJZm9XN1JiNnFnSHZEM1BsazZCRFZWSVgzXzZDOU4wOGktVkdaUFlzRmhWYUhweGFuMVlBY194Z0hsRllJMXV1V0ljcnhWcU9vOXhfR0NRQ1l0QUE2OU1qN0tIWE9DcWhOYk56QjNQaFY1MzdKaUVpSDBB?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen).

- **Count Salomon Brothers CEO Chip Daniels** in favor of President Trump's proposal to create a U.S. strategic reserve of digital assets. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/10/why-trump-is-right-on-a-digital-currency-reserve))  

- **Robinhood's CEO Vlad Tenev** wants to use blockchain tech to help small investors trade shares of privately held companies. ([Washington Post](https://news.google.com/read/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOYWdFUnZJbVZ4TDhZNnl5Q1V0M1BXelc2ZDBoWVQ0bHZ1UVRTWmxWWDNIZU54UFhxYzRaY191V0R6cy1adXdVUjRocWJiQjZBQXRVOGJBQ1J0VDcxdGdNV1dERVNQRWd1ZUt5bU5EZTBzZDZ0TG5zb2VHZ0xNbVJGc0V6dnBzWURyVi1SbGFlTGlwelVZZ2F0eEh3WE8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **Author Lee McIntyre,** who's written two books about the spread disinformation, isn't a big fan of crowdsourcing as a way to combat the problem. In [a Q&A](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQTWMzWjZjYVdZZ1M3dGt4YVZPbmZRZW5GRmwwcjJQdjQydGVaeUNGTFVwX2tZRlhnaUpNZ0tmWHhFVlA1MVVCVWZlNmlZdVlVdmlOM3VLWWZsTGtLYm5RTjRqVm1yRVkzM0lJQ3h0SXhoNE9iaXFIZWtsYTl3TkVZWVR5REdkYXpnaW1UMXNRdHhhOWY3T3V3eTNtcWJobGFTU2FRaVY0NUpxeG8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) with the Post's Jasmine M. Green, McIntyre says it would be more effective if users would make the difficult admission they can be fooled by disnformation. They should thus rely more heavily on specific trusted news sources, and those high-quality news providers should make more content free. That way, the truth could better compete for attention with lies, which are always free.

- **Psychiatrist Anna Lembke** spoke with the New York Times' Lulu Garcia-Navarro about addiction to ["digital drugs"](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9senBGMERuTlc2b1hlM1cyQWpSMVpaRWxiQzkzSldmb2RRSEdMZ0FuUU0yYnF2R1ktT01YNHNTWC0tbkg2cjdqS2lFMU9OSnFwb1hGcm53SmdJM0hpcW9wNHFTcEVJSzh2V1FxVkVsTXhwZnBrai0zcVhB?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) like social apps and online pornography.

OK. On to some notable breaking headlines...

### Week in Review: Feb. 9-15, 2025

- **AI researchers in China say** they have observed that large-language models from Meta and Alibaba are able to replicate themselves in testing. Their findings signal AI has passed a critical "red line" in terms of posing safety risks for humans. ([Space.com](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/tech/ai-can-now-replicate-itself-a-milestone-that-has-experts-terrified))

- **A group of investors led by Elon Musk** bid $97.4 billion to [acquire OpenAI](https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-openai-bid-4af12827?st=oRSCfV&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). OpenAI's board promptly and unanimously [rejected the offer](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/openai-rejects-elon-musks-97-4-billion/). But it could nevertheless [complicate](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-sam-altman-openai-bid-chatgpt-58d9bc3d59497468d7b37ecd5d9ff5e6) the nonprofit OpenAI's plan to restructure as a for-profit company.

- **TikTok returned to the U.S. app stores for iOS and Android devices**, ending a nearly monthlong absence. The platform's parent ByteDance received assurances from the U.S. Department of Justice that a ban won't be enforced for now. But TikTok's future access to the American market remains uncertain if it doesn't find a U.S. buyer. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/02/14/tiktok-is-back-in-apple-google-app-stores-in-us/))

- **Bitcoin network activity hit a 12-month low.** A marked shift in traffic for memecoins, non-fungible tokens, and other non-monetary use cases to other blockchains has reduced the Bitcoin platform's transaction volume, according to analysts. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/340061/bitcoin-network-activity-hits-12-month-lows-as-transactions-drop-55-from-peak))

- **BlackRock has been buying a lot of MicroStrategy shares.** The asset manager, which has primarily been in the news over the past year as an issuer of exchange-traded bitcoin funds, has gradually built a 5% ownership stake in MSTR. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/07/blackrock-increases-ownership-of-strategy-to-5))

- **CoinDesk will will host** the first Hong Kong edition of its Consensus conference series [beginning Tuesday](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-hong-kong-2025-coverage/2025/02/14/what-to-expect-at-consensus-hong-kong).

- **The Bank of England's chief** said stablecoins should require a "high bar" of global regulation. Speaking to University of Chicago business students in London, he also confirmed that Britain's central bank is continuing to explore the potential for a "digital pound." And he said he hopes to see a clearer U.S. regulatory framework under the new presidential administration. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/339980/bank-of-england-stablecoins-bitcoin-cbdc))

- **James Howell, an early bitcoin investor,** is trying to buy a landfill in South Wales where he believes he can find and retrieve a hard drive he mistakenly discarded in 2013 with $800 million of tokens stored on it. ([New York Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOUVlteHZuUnBrSDRyZG5SZ1dpaXRYX2ZoOHJUZDFIaVpSV3hBaUoxcUoxOWx3ajVmZXN5czBmY29pekRhY3FicnVBNnl5UE1GbktFcDU3REFzUk9NZkJIUUoyb2tqRkJvZkQ2Q193bFhkZThnU0FpX0liY3pjdDVqeGVvOUlvWUJYaDlrM2ZUMjY5Z1k?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **Clearly, this situation is all crypto's fault.** Federal agents arrested a Las Vegas man on fraud charges in connection with a $25 million Ponzi scheme. According to court documents, he told investors he would  generate returns by using AI to mine crypto. But he was in fact using their money to buy real estate and pay off earlier investors. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/341133/las-vegas-man-indicted-for-obtaining-24-million-from-at-least-400-investors-in-alleged-crypto-ponzi-scheme))


### Community

**FYI & FWIW,** below are links worth for a couple of academic alumni communities I've recently either joined or started. Mentioning here because I know they have significant overlap with w3w's readership:

- **The National Merit Scholarship Corp. is trying** to build deeper connections among its past scholarship recipients, from all eras. If you've ever participated in any of their programs, including National Achievement Scholars, National Hispanic Scholars, et cetera, they'd really like to hear from you [here](https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1758/scholarship2.aspx?sid=1758&gid=2&pgid=8&cid=46&sitebuilder=1).

- **I've started a new e-mail listserv** for fellow grads of Florida A&M's journalism school, to give us a space to share information independent of any Big Tech platform. FAMU journalism alums can [sign up here](https://www.freelists.org/list/sjgcrattlers).

### Odds & Ends

- **A humpback whale briefly swallowed a 24-year-old kayaker** off the coast of Chile and spat him out unscathed. The man was out on the water with his father, who captured the extraordinary encounter [on video](https://x.com/AP/status/1890185435009212605) from a separate kayak. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/chile-kayaking-tourism-whale-b0cafde4b640326f20a9da28003d6c26))

- **Read it upside-down and weep.** For whatever reason, YouTube's algorithm just surfaced for me a Houston TV station's story from 2019 about a decision by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles to prohibit a Lamborghini owner's personalized plate. It read "370H55V," which the DMV belatedly deemed too "offensive" for the road. ([KPRC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwp_ObYAFMg))
