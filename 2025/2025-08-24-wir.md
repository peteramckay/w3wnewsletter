### Five Things: Aug. 17-23, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **Token prices ended** an otherwise humdrum week on Wall Street [with a flourish](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-and-crypto-stocks-surge-as-powells-rate-cut-hint-revives-risk-appetite/ar-AA1L2Er8?ocid=BingNewsVerp) Friday after remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that America's central bank may cut its benchmark interest-rate target soon. Bitcoin leapt 4% Friday to finish around break-even for the week. Bitcoin's price remains shy of its all-time highs, but miners are nevertheless [feeling squeezed](https://decrypt.co/335878/bitcoin-hashrate-soars-fees-below-1-percent) by recent records in the Bitcoin network's hashrate. That makes it more difficult and less profitable for miners to verify transactions and mint new tokens.

- **A wave of new stablecoins:** Bullish settled payments on its IPO with $1.2B in stablecoin payments. <!-- Link TK --> | Wyoming rolled out its own stablecoin. <!-- Link TK --> | MetaMask has unleashed its first-ever native stablecoin, MetaMask USD (mUSD)—fully integrated into the wallet ecosystem via Bridge (a Stripe unit) and powered by M0—launching initially on Ethereum and Linea, and soon usable for on-chain activities and real-world purchases via a MetaMask Mastercard. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/367713/metamask-musd-stablecoin-ethereum-linea-stripe-bridge)) | World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, backed by Treasury bills and cash equivalents, has been added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap—and shortly listed—following a minting of $205 million new tokens that brought total circulation to $2.4 billion, marking a significant expansion for the Trump-backed crypto project.

- Scaramucci's SkyBridge Capital plans to tokenize $300M in hedge fund shares. Link TK.

- **Federal prosecutors charged** a 22-year-old Oregon man with operating a vast network of hacked devices that may be the largest botnet ever. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/oregon-man-accused-of-operating-one-of-most-powerful-attack-botnets-ever-seen-380b2caf?st=tzBB1N&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

### Looking Ahead

- **The Washington Post's Drew Harwell** explored the [rise of "AI slop" videos](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/17/ai-video-slop-creators/), a low-effort, often surreal subgenre that you've probably noticed proliferating on your favorite social network lately. Harwell gives a nice overview of who exactly is making this stuff and what the long-term effects on the web's creative economy might be. (Spoiler alert: They're probably not good.)

- **Mental health pros are growing concerned about "AI psychosis."** While the term isn't yet a formal clinical diagnosis, it's increasingly being used to describe alarming patterns of delusional thinking, emotional dependency, and distorted reality emerging in some users after extended interaction with chatbots. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/19/ai-psychosis-chatgpt-explained-mental-health/))

- **Google’s unveiled** its [new lineup](https://www.wired.com/story/google-pixel-10-series-pixel-watch-4-pixel-buds-2a/) of Pixel devices, emphasizing [AI features](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/google-pixel-10-launch-a-strategic-ai-play-with-gemini.html) to take on Apple's iPhone more directly. Early reviews have generally ben [favorable](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on). Nevertheless, the Washington Post's Shira Ovide says Google faces an uphill battle for market share. From its early launch, the search giant has positioned the Pixel line as an Android flagship. But Ovide notes that historically [hasn't translated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/19/best-android-phone-google-pixel-apple-samsung/) into strong sales.

### Odds & Ends

- **Food-inspired "gourmand" fragrances are hot.** Singer Melanie Martinez is re-releasing her Cry Baby Milk perfume, which has hints of strawberries, milk, and caramel scent. It has been off the market since 2020, but demand remains so high, old bottles of it have been selling online for over $1,000 each.
