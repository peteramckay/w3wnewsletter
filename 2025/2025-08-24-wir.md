**There have been some surprising twists lately** in how tech companies get funded, which investors have access, and who benefits. Over time, the implications could be massive both for privately held startups and listed Big Tech stalwarts alike.

At the startup-y end of the spectrum, The Block reports that crypto companies have [raised over $15 billion](https://www.theblock.co/post/367485/digital-asset-treasuries-eclipse-venture-funding-as-companies-raise-15-billion-in-2025) this year through digital-asset treasuries, outpacing traditional investment rounds by venture capital firms. The volume of traditional VC deals with crypto startups has plunged 56% so far this year.

Some background: The listed business-services firm Strategy pioneered digital-asset treasuries in 2020, when it began acquiring bitcoin as an alternative to holding traditional dollar deposits and U.S. Treasury debt in its corporate cash reserve. As bitcoin's token price has generally risen over the years, Strategy's stock-market valuation has as well, based increasingly on the amount of bitcoin on its books.  

For Strategy, which was founded in 1989 under the monicker MicroStrategy, adopting bitcoin in 2020 was a big pivot at a time when the company was already pretty mature, after it had built up a conventional business generating income from clients.

By contrast, startups have been recently building *from scratch* as digital-asset treasury (DAT) companies. In many cases, that's meant raising money to build their token stockpiles from zero, with no other revenue streams in place. Hence this is where tokenized treasuries have begun to compete more directly with the old-school VC business.

Other aspects of this trend to watch:

- **Bitcoin remains by far** the most popular treasury asset among companies for now. But ether and various altcoins have been making inroads. The combined ETH holdings of 69 digital-asset treasury (DAT) entities now surpass $17 billion, according to [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/367749/ethereum-treasuries-surpass-17-billion).

- **Case in point:** Former BTC miner BitMine Immersion Technologies just announced an [expansion of its ETH reserve](https://decrypt.co/335613/bitmine-adds-1-7-billion-ethereum-second-strategy-crypto-treasury) to $6.6 billion, more than 1% percent of all ETH tokens in circulation. That now makes it the second-largest DAT company, behind only Strategy.

- **Forbes' Julie Goldenberg** notes that a lot of "picks-and-shovels" financial firms providing services to DAT companies are [racking up big profits](https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliegoldenberg/2025/08/19/whos-getting-rich-off-the-100-billion-crypto-treasury-boom/) from the boom. These include various crypto custodians, brokers, asset managers and investment banks.

- **Many conventional VCs** have of course turned their attention to AI of late.

investments is still robust.

Silicon Valley investors have poured $100 million into a luxury, AI-enhanced mattress system—starting at $2,500 for the topper and more than $4,000 for the full setup—paired with a $17–$25 monthly subscription for extra features, with high-profile users like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Scarlett Johansson, and biohacker Bryan Johnson fueling its hype and a rumored $500 million valuation. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/336128/silicon-valley-throws-100m-at-ai-powered-mattress-with-a-subscription)) | OpenAI is in final talks to facilitate a $6 billion secondary share sale by employees and former staffers to investors such as SoftBank and Thrive Capital—potentially catapulting the company’s valuation to $500 billion, making it the most valuable private firm globally—surpassing even SpaceX.

### Five Things: Aug. 17-23, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **Token prices ended** an otherwise humdrum week on Wall Street [with a flourish](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-and-crypto-stocks-surge-as-powells-rate-cut-hint-revives-risk-appetite/ar-AA1L2Er8?ocid=BingNewsVerp) Friday after remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that America's central bank may cut its benchmark interest-rate target soon. Bitcoin leapt 4% Friday to finish around break-even for the week. Bitcoin's price remains shy of its all-time highs, but miners are nevertheless [feeling squeezed](https://decrypt.co/335878/bitcoin-hashrate-soars-fees-below-1-percent) by recent records in the Bitcoin network's hashrate. That makes it more difficult and less profitable for miners to verify transactions and mint new tokens.

- **A wave of new stablecoins:** Bullish settled payments on its IPO with $1.2B in stablecoin payments. <!-- Link TK --> | Wyoming rolled out its own stablecoin. <!-- Link TK --> | MetaMask has unleashed its first-ever native stablecoin, MetaMask USD (mUSD)—fully integrated into the wallet ecosystem via Bridge (a Stripe unit) and powered by M0—launching initially on Ethereum and Linea, and soon usable for on-chain activities and real-world purchases via a MetaMask Mastercard. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/367713/metamask-musd-stablecoin-ethereum-linea-stripe-bridge)) | World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, backed by Treasury bills and cash equivalents, has been added to Coinbase’s listing roadmap—and shortly listed—following a minting of $205 million new tokens that brought total circulation to $2.4 billion, marking a significant expansion for the Trump-backed crypto project.

### Looking Ahead

- **The Washington Post's Drew Harwell** explored the [rise of "AI slop" videos](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/17/ai-video-slop-creators/), a low-effort, often surreal subgenre that you've probably noticed proliferating on your favorite social network lately. Harwell gives a nice overview of who exactly is making this stuff and what the long-term effects on the web's creative economy might be. (Spoiler alert: They're probably not good.)

- **Mental health pros are growing concerned about "AI psychosis."** While the term isn't yet a formal clinical diagnosis, it's increasingly being used to describe alarming patterns of delusional thinking, emotional dependency, and distorted reality emerging in some users after extended interaction with chatbots. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/19/ai-psychosis-chatgpt-explained-mental-health/))

- **Google unveiled** its [new lineup](https://www.wired.com/story/google-pixel-10-series-pixel-watch-4-pixel-buds-2a/) of Pixel devices, emphasizing [AI features](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/google-pixel-10-launch-a-strategic-ai-play-with-gemini.html) to take on Apple's iPhone more directly. Early reviews have generally been [favorable](https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on). Nevertheless, the Washington Post's Shira Ovide says Google faces an uphill battle for market share. Since the Pixel's initial early launch, the search giant has positioned the line as an Android flagship. But Ovide notes that historically [hasn't translated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/19/best-android-phone-google-pixel-apple-samsung/) into strong sales.

### Odds & Ends

- **Food-inspired "gourmand" fragrances are hot.** Singer Melanie Martinez is re-releasing her Cry Baby Milk perfume, which has hints of strawberries, milk, and caramel scent. It has been off the market since 2020, but demand remains so high, old bottles of it have been selling online for over $1,000 each.
