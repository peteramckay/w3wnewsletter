*<strong>Before we begin,</strong> a big thank-you to the paid subscribers who help the w3w newsletter bring readers the latest news about Bitcoin, Ethereum, AI, and other emerging tech. I'm glad to maintain a free distribution tier as well, to make this information available more widely. But if you're able, please do consider upgrading to a paid plan [on Substack](https://w3wnews.substack.com/subscribe).* ðŸ˜Š

**Two years ago,** I began [my first tentative experiments](https://medium.com/the-modern-scientist/robots-and-humans-a-new-era-in-journalism-b07bd6d33eb5) integrating AI tools into my workflow for this newsletter. Like many folks, I've been fiddling around ever since with different tools, scrambling to keep up with the dizzying pace of product releases, trying to discern which apps and models are best at which tasks, and so on. That process has so far been pretty ad-hoc for me, frankly.

Now I'm adding more strucure, including an open-source component that I want to invite everyone into with this update. Here's how it works:

- **The general idea** is to provide greater visibility into the editorial process for w3w, especially AI-assisted parts that may be of interest to developers or news organizations trying to innovate for this new era. As a bonus, the changes described below should improve transparency and trust for all readers.

- **If you want to follow along,** or contribute, the place to do that will be the coding site GitHub. I've long maintained a [repository of w3w content](https://github.com/peteramckay/w3wnewsletter) there, for purposes of preserving a full archive of the newsletter away from hosted blogging platforms that can always be shut down if they're no longer profitable for their shareholders, etc. The repo was previously private, visible only to me. But I've now made it public, free to use with appropriate attribution under [Creative Commons 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

- **I've previously commited to the repo** about once or twice a week, usually as a final step for archival purposes on Sundays, with a minimal description attached to each commit.

- **Beginning with this edition,** commits will be more frequent, including descriptions that specify changes based on queries to specific AI platforms. You can see the new approach in the [GitHub commit history](https://github.com/peteramckay/w3wnewsletter/commits/master/2025/2025-04-13-wir.md) for this edition of the newsleter, for example.

- **In addition, full text of my AI prompts** and the relevant app's output text will be included in a comment at the top of the markdown file in each commit. You can see an example in [this commit](https://github.com/peteramckay/w3wnewsletter/commit/27aa37d6332cee60580d9eb9d4bda47da84b793a) I made late yesterday.

- **In the final published version of each week's newsletter,** I'm going to summarize which AI tools I used, to give some transparency to readers who *aren't* on GitHub. Production of this week's edition included help from Copilot, the Brave browser's Leo feature, ChatGPT, and NotebookLM. And the illustration this week is a file image I created with DALLÂ·E back in 2023.

- **I welcome issue reports on GitHub, pull requests, and other contributions as well.** May as well use the site's full feature set, of course.



### Five Things: April 6-12, 2025

The week's most important headlines for emerging tech:

- **Markets got a temporary reprieve on tariffs.** Stocks and crypto finished a volatile week with modest gains after the Trump administration announced it would pause tariffs for 90 days on imports into the U.S. from most countries -- with the notable exception of China. In particular, the tech industry hailed [tariff exemptions for imported gadgets](https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-exempts-smartphones-other-electronics-from-chinese-tariffs-dd8eb31f?st=P2Eafr&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) announced late Friday. The S&P 500 [snapped](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-weaker-start-fedex-nike-shares-slump/card/u-s-stocks-end-higher-friday-as-s-p-500-snaps-four-straight-weeks-of-losses-MgwIOqiuNIPFtfjFUvFM) a four-week losing streak, and bitcoin traded with a 7-day gain of nearly 3% as of late Saturday in New York.

- **The longer-term picture for the U.S. remains murky, however.** For a thorough yet accessible discussion of the risks ahead, I would highly recommend [the latest episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5h_C1tu_U) of the Prof G Markets podcast, by venture investor and author Scott Galloway.  (Note: There is some characteristically off-color humor by Galloway at the beginning of the show. But if you can tolerate that, the rest is very much worth a listen on its analytical merits.) To very briefly summarize his concerns: It's still worrisome that U.S. tariff policy is now effectively at the whim of just one man, which subject to change at any moment. That makes it difficult for companies to plan new spending and projects. (Case in point: On Sunday, White House officials [qualified](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topstories/us-commerce-secretary-says-exempted-electronic-products-to-come-under-separate-tariffs/ar-AA1CPHQG) their earlier stance on electronics, saying targeted tariffs on some devices are still likely.) No wonder the S&P 500 has been trading more like a rumor-driven "meme stock" lately, and bond prices [have fallen](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/treasury-bond-yield-set-for-largest-weekly-rise-since-1981-this-isn-t-normal-and-it-worries-wall-street/ar-AA1CL5cn) at a time when investors are hungry for safe havens. Participants effectively rejected U.S. Treasury debt for that purpose last week, signaling a shift in overseas investors' perceptions of America that could persist much longer, Galloway says.

- **Other Washington stories to watch:** The Department of Justice [disbanded](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-disbands-cryptocurrency-enforcement-unit-2025-04-08/) its crypto enforcement team... Trump [signed his first crypto-related bill](https://decrypt.co/314409/trump-first-president-sign-crypto-bill) into law Thursday, eliminating an IRS rule imposing strict reporting rules on decentralized finance (DeFI) platforms... The Securities and Exchange Commission [dropped its case](https://decrypt.co/314437/sec-dismisses-helium-case-ending-gary-genslers-final-act) against Nova Labs, saying the tokens its Helium network uses to manage internet-connected devices aren't securities. The decision set a striking contrast to the enforcement approach of the Biden administration... A new Senate bill could [hit data centers for crypto and AI](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-bill-threatens-crypto-ai-data-centers-fees-report) with fees if they exceed federal emissions targets...  The Atlantic's Matteo Wong says the White House's recent attack on academic research is [jeopardizing American leadership](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/trump-jeopardizing-ai-boom/682404/) in AI.

- **Institutional crypto whales have been taking some hits.** BlackRock's crypto asset holdings have [decreased by $5 billion](https://decrypt.co/314499/blackrock-crypto-asset-holdings-down-5-billion-bitcoin-ethereum-fall) in value due to recent price declines in bitcoin and ether, according to the Wall Street giant's latest earnings release. And Strategy, the listed consulting company formerly known as MicroStrategy, said for the first time in regulatory filings that [it might have to sell bitcoin](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE0wZmc2RWsySkFyUWh0a3VEbGtmUXBVZTFyNWVScWtPdEFpZWlxU0cyb1c2VUM3RG1lMklxVDBiYUVBRS1VSlpwYVhkZkFSYVFPMEJUUWhtTmVXN1QySklEc3NjOTA2dw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) if market conditions deteriorate enough. The warning contrasts markedly with company founder Michael Saylor's past remarks that bitcoin holders should never sell their tokens.

- **The stablecoin Tether** has drawn uncomfortably [within reach](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tether-flip-ethereum-jan3-ceo-141558019.html) of surpassing ether as the world's number-two crypto token by market valuation. USDT's float now stands at $144 billion, less than $50 billion shy of ETH's valuation. The latter has struggled amid increased competition from Solana and other app-focused blockchain platforms this year.   

### Odds & Ends

- **Caribbean countries are trying** to turn a plague of sargassum, a type of seaweed, into a variety of useful products, including biofuel for vehicles, fertilizer, bricks, and pharmaceuticals. ([Washington Post](https://news.google.com/read/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPQm9hRGxHSVJTOU14Yzh2eWdqZEh2b1JkaHYxaDlMd3IyeDR1QVBNcFBjUklyXzRlOWJQbDJYWFBOd2dmWXJUMkdzckdTNVR6dkhiZVFxdU1JN3dtTVpweTdFSW9GTlRkcVZHdHQ3azRzeUR0elYyNGNpQ0ZRNDZKWnJobG9QZEZEcnpHODVyejRYQUJzRkY0TWxHRlEzdTA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **Yay?** People have begun using ChatGPT to turn their photos [into action figures](https://www.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-ai-action-figure-trend-what-is-it-and-how-can-i-join-in-200532692.html).
