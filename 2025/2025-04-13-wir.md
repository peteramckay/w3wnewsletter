### Five Things: April 6-12, 2025

- **Markets got a reprieve on tariffs, for now.** Stocks and crypto finished a volatile week with modest gains after the Trump administration announced it would pause tariffs for 90 days on imports into the U.S. from most countries -- with the notable exception of China. The tech industry also hailed a round of tailored [tariff exemptions for imported gadgets](https://www.wsj.com/tech/trump-exempts-smartphones-other-electronics-from-chinese-tariffs-dd8eb31f?st=P2Eafr&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink), announced late Friday. The S&P 500 [snapped](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-500-and-nasdaq-set-for-weaker-start-fedex-nike-shares-slump/card/u-s-stocks-end-higher-friday-as-s-p-500-snaps-four-straight-weeks-of-losses-MgwIOqiuNIPFtfjFUvFM) a four-week losing streak, and bitcoin traded with a 7-day gain of nearly 3% as of late Saturday in New York.

- **However, the longer-term picture for the U.S. remains murky,** for reasons I would say the [Prof G Markets podcast covered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP5h_C1tu_U) very thoroughly and acceseibly. To very briefly summarize the concerns of host Scott Galloway & Co: It's still worrisome that U.S. tariff policy is now effectively at the whim of just one man, who clearly has zero regard for America's decades-long preference for openness on trade. Even if he's announced good news for now, what if he does the opposite on a moment's notice later? No wonder the S&P 500 has been trading more like a rumor-driven "meme stock" lately, and bond prices [have fallen](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/treasury-bond-yield-set-for-largest-weekly-rise-since-1981-this-isn-t-normal-and-it-worries-wall-street/ar-AA1CL5cn) at a time when investors are hungry for safe havens. Investors effectively rejected U.S. Treasury debt for that purpose last week, signaling a shift in overseas investors' perceptions of America that could persist much longer, Galloway says.

- **Other Washington stories to watch:** The Atlantic's Matteo Wong says the White House's attack on academic research is [jeopardizing American leadership](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/trump-jeopardizing-ai-boom/682404/) in AI, which relies on collaboration among universities, government, and industry. <!-- ([]()) | **Trump became the first president to sign a crypto bill into law**, ending an anti-DeFi IRS rule, signaling a significant shift in US regulation of the crypto space.

This development could have substantial implications for the growth and operation of crypto and AI infrastructure in the US.  ([]()) | DOJ dissolves its crypto task force. ([]()) SEC dismissed Helium case.  -->
