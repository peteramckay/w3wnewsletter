- DRIFT: Chaos of the Trump admin is quickly overtaking Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, it seems. Some great quotes on this from both anchor Sonali Basak and BitGet CEO Gracy Chen in 2/18 edition of Bloomberg Crypto. Link TK.

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_
