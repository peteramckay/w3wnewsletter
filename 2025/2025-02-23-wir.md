**Ethereum's founder is pushing back against the narrative** that the decentralized app platform is falling behind competitors like Solana. That might not be as crazy as it sounds.

CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk [reports](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/20/vitalik-buterin-disappointed-with-lack-of-embrace-for-blockchain-casinos):

<blockquote><em>
<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his disappointment with some ETH community members and thought it was ‚Äúbad‚Äù that the ecosystem was too welcoming for ‚Äúcasinos.‚Äù</p>

<p>During an ask-me-anything (AMA) on Tako, Buterin responded to a question about whether he had felt disappointed at the Ethereum Foundation, the crypto industry or the community. He answered ‚Äúof course,‚Äù especially when others question why Ethereum has not been more open to applications with blockchain gambling, seemingly taking a jab at its competitor, Solana, and how their ecosystem has embraced a lot of memecoin activity over the past year.</p>
</em></blockquote>

**Why it matters:** Since the meltdown of FTX in November 2022 -- a pivotal event for the entire crypto industry -- Solana's network activity and valuation have exploded, easily outpacing Ethereum's growth. The ether token's market capitalization of $378 billion is now "just" four times that of Solana, compared to six times greater prior to FTX's collapse, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) data.

Hence there has been anxiety -- and occasional recrimination -- in the Ethereum community lately about the direction of the platform.

But beyond the raw numbers, Buterin raises some points worth considering about *how* exactly the broader web3 ecosystem has reached its new status quo and what role Ethereum should play in the future.

Solana has certainly become the go-to platform lately for developers launching memecoins, which by definition [carry no intrinsic value](https://www.investopedia.com/meme-coin-6750312). That includes the Solana-based coins trading under the tickers TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA that have recently sparked government corruption scandals in the [U.S.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/20/tech/meme-coins-donald-melania-trump-intl-hnk/index.html) and [Argentina](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-cryptocurrency-fraud-charges-3f572a5f294d7c25437a08151798b917).

If Buterin, who [leads the Ethereum Foundation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/buterin-announces-leadership-changes-ethereum-foundation), wants to cede such sketchy ground to Solana and focus instead on quality over quantity, that probably wouldn't be the worst thing for Ethereum long term.

([New York Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1PNEpHMTRSZE5XRFlFOFA1bElpLVJMdzB4aFJoSmlFSnBzZ0VPUmdIZDdNQ3ZUSmFKQVR0bFc0aVpZeXJvZGJRRVNLdDRXZC14RWstelFubkt5SnFSWVBiRkloTUdQeWlmUV9Tc3IxVmpfMFFZbHFWMk45MA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/02/18/youtube-at-20-the-video-platform-transformed-screen-entertainment-now-it-could-change-a-lot-more/))

### Odds & Ends

- **Amazon MGM announced** it has reached an agreement to [take creative control](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/amazon-mgm-takes-creative-reins-144531572.html) of the James Bond film franchise, ending decades of family control. The deal appears to close out a feud that the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db?st=jth3B4&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) in December between Amazon and Barbara Broccoli, whose father produced Bond movies going back to 1962's Dr. No.
