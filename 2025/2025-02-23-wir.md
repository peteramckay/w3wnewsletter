<!-- 100-word lead item...

Some string leftover from last week that may be useful:

**Some poking around on Google News quickly confirmed for me** that the mainstream tech press has been seriously undercovering

The mainstream tech press is an extension of the business press. Hence they tend to interpret the news through the frame of who's making the most money off a technology at scale.

There's certainly a lot of merit to that approach, of course. Understandably, a lot of readers and viewers are keenly interested in it as well. But it also has blind spots. These include:

- **Important technical breakthroughs that haven't yet been commercialized.**

- Innovation done outside companies, either in universities or self-organizing open source communities. This is how we got things like the worldwide web, tk, and tk.


**Become a paid subscriber to w3w.** The newsletter offers several paid options, each with extra perks compared to the free tier. That includes access to comment on Substack, subscriber-only content posted there, and chat features. Plus you get my deepest gratitude and some good karma for supporting w3w. [Sign up today!](https://w3wnews.substack/subscribe) ☯️ 😉  
**Since Americans barely trust one another anymore,** especially on anything related to government policy, perhaps a trusted friend's opinions should carry increased value.
*“We don't yet know what the Trump administration is going to propose in terms of reforms on crypto regulation,” Bailey said, according to a transcript of a Q&A session following his speech provided by the BoE press office. <strong>“I think that the Biden administration, my impression is particularly the SEC, had got into a situation where it couldn't get a regulatory framework and was using action through the courts. And that was becoming more challenging, frankly. So there is a gap there in terms of having a consistent regulatory framework,</strong> but we don't know what that's going to be.”*

Musk, Kanye were largely radicalized on social. (Abuse of various drugs and being surrounded offline by sycophants and hangers-on in their everyday lives also probably doesn't help.)

_**That's it for now. Thanks for reading the newsletter today!**_

_**About me: I'm a New York-based consultant and writer with more than seven years' experience in web3. This newsletter grew out of the early stages of that journey, as I thought it might be useful to share what I was rapidly learning about blockchain tech and decentralization at the time with other people doing the same.**_

 _**During the COVID pandemic, I served as Head of Content for the censorship-resistant platform Blogchain. I have also done contract work for the World Economic Forum, the Telos Foundation, Dispatch Labs, and Vice News. Previously, I spent over a decade as an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal.**_
