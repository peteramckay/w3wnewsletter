# Is *this* your "crypto president," America?
## Like something out of a social-media meme, this presidency isn't exactly going as investors thought it would.

**The reality of a second Trump administration** is demonstrably not quite measuring up to crypto investors' giddy hopes during the campaign season.

To be sure, returns in major market metrics from November's election to present still look mostly positive:

- **Bitcoin:** +27%
- **Ether:** -8.7%
- **Global Crypto Market Cap:** +25%
- **S&P 500:** +1%
- **Gold:** +7%

A big caveat, though: The gains above were rung up entirely during America's [unusually long](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/presidential-transition-length-reasons-history.html) presidential transition period compared to our global peers.

The market picture becomes much bleaker if we zoom in on just the period since Donald Trump was inaugurated and actually assumed duties as U.S. president on Jan. 20.

Market returns from that date to present:

- **Bitcoin:** -15%
- **Ether:** -32%
- **Global Crypto Market Cap:** -19%
- **S&P 500:** -4%
- **Gold:** +6%

**Why it matters:** The crypto industry threw [record support](https://theintercept.com/2024/11/07/crypto-donors-trump-congress-regulations/) behind Trump's campaign in 2024, based largely on his promises to become America's first "crypto president." He pledged easier regulation, closer coordination with the industry in general, and potential creation of a strategic crypto reserve that could become a major buyer of tokens.

Trump has certainly delivered a [lighter regulatory touch](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5170036-trump-sec-crypto-industry-changes/) and [pro-crypto appointments](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-appoints-former-paypal-coo-david-sacks-ai-crypto-czar-2024-12-06/) to major administration jobs so far. But the rest of the forumula has become muddied.

Three major setbacks:

- **Misadventures in shitcoins.** The Trump family's efforts to enrich itself through [a decentralized finance project](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/09/18/trumps-wlfi-crypto-venture-raises-ethical-concerns-before-election/) and [memecoin launches](https://cryptoslate.com/trumps-memecoin-is-a-self-serving-disaster-risking-legitimacy-of-crypto-mark-cuban/) have played into the worst perceptions of the industry among the general public. They also sap credibility from any new pro-crypto policies, giving opponents an easy opening to allege self-dealing. This stuff is not helpful to the broader crypto industry, period.  

- **The reserve plan undwhelmed.** Markets largely [shrugged off](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/08/xrp-ada-sol-fall-deeper-than-bitcoin-as-white-house-crypto-summit-fails-to-wow-traders) Trump's crypto summit Friday, including announcement of an executive order to create a crypto reserve. The plan now chiefly seems to entail the government holding onto bitcoin it has previously seized in criminal cases. But Trump's remarks didn't seem to indicate a wave of new buying that traders had hoped for from the government. And earlier commitments to include certain altcoins in the reserve now seem on shakier ground.

- **He's making the macro environment much worse.** In other words, crypto is proving to be just as vulnerable as everything else to Trump's chaotic economic and national-security policies. This is perhaps the area where crypto's donor class made its greatest miscalculation during the election.

[Blowing up](https://www.wsj.com/world/trump-is-overturning-the-world-order-that-america-built-10981637?st=QeKSmU&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) America's post-World War II alliances or [starting a tariff war](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/09/business/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-recession/index.html) with the country's three biggest international trading partners simultaneously may not be about crypto per se. But make no mistake, they are very bad for business in their own way.

The problem is that crypto is still largely a speculative, [risk-on](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-on-risk-off.asp) investment cateogry. And Trump's macro policies are loudly discouraging all forms of new investment risk, raising new worries about [stagflation](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/06/rate-fears-replace-tariff-fears-as-crypto-pulls-back), war, and other pitfalls.

Against that backdrop, investors are seeking safe havens right now, not adding exposure to riskier, volatile stuff. That has meant lightening up on both crypto [and stocks](https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-tariffs-rates-jobs-bitcoin-d414257dbb4c9f45b0ad075e12c63451), much to Wall Street's chagrin last week.

In theory, it's still so early in the new presidency that Trump could yet turn things around in terms of implementing changes of lasting value to the crypto community. But to do that, he would likely have to abandon some of his most cherished isolationist policies.

### Week in Review: March 2-8, 2025

- **The decentralized finance platform Kava** unveiled what is believed to be the largest decentralized AI platform to date, powered by DeepSeek's R1 model.

- **The startup Scale AI announced** it has signed a contract with the U.S. Defense Department to lead a project called "Thunderforge" in which commanders will use artificial intelligence to plan and help execute movements of ships, planes and other assets. ([Washington Post](https://news.google.com/read/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOb25VN3JuWG9Rd1l1LWJfYm4wa01iSEI3X05hMFN5cGZBZGV6YjJWYlZkLUhIVktmZ1pXWVJtallQNnctRzNpQVJraTdXSmNYeHZrS3FrZnZjV0tLUnpqN1pTMllzcmc1VnU1Tno2TDBvUFVHTUpkSGI3LVV2eXJ4SVlhekRaM2M?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

USDe's market capitalization has more than doubled since mid-October [to reach $5.5 billion](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethena-usde/) in recent trading, according to CoinMarketCap. However, that is still a far cry from the valuations of stablecoin leaders [Tether](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) and [USDC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/).

- **It appears Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen** lost roughly $150 million worth of tokens last year to hackers because of a leak of his LastPass user data. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/345212/ripple-co-founder-chris-larsen-losing-over-100-million-of-xrp-tied-to-lastpass-hack-says-zachxbt))  

### Odds & Ends
