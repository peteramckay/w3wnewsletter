America's politicians want you to know they are sorry to remove your access to TikTok. It was all a temporary misunderstanding, you see. But they had to do it to protect you from the Chinese Communist Party, because those people don't believe in freedom like we do.

There is all sorts of harm they might theoretically do, or perhaps have already done, while giving you unlimited web hosting capacity to exercise your constitutionally protected First Amendment right. So we had to ignore that last part in order to prevent the first part.


ure, you might only use it to post silly dances.  


And they might, possibly do really bad things to our country. Yes


Because of what these people may theoretically due to you, or perhaps have already done, albeit while giving you free web hosting for videos of you silly dancing

**America's newly enacted TikTok ban** is a perfect collision of our persistent pro-democracy self-image, our our discordant but undeniably increasing antidemocratic impulses, and our paralytic day-to-day politics.

The tension between America's pro-democracy self-image, rooted in events decades or centuries ago, versus the reality of its undeniably increasing antidemocratic impulses in the present day is boiling over in the newly effective TikTok ban.
Good news is the topic is very timely. Some unintended consequences to watch concerning the TikTok ban:

1. He's run Twitter into the ground.

The TikTok imbroglio should be a warning on three fronts for tech world.

1. The real threats to free speech are nation-states, not private moderation.
2. We need social regulation for everyone.
3. Educating users on infosec remains an uphill battle.

- CNN showed high percentage of TikTok users who are likely to migrate to YouTube and Instagram. In other words, our oligarchic giants will win from this.

- US market is very lucrative. Could ByteDance have a viable biz without it, though?

- Chinese disinfo could simply increase on poorly policed US-owned networks.
