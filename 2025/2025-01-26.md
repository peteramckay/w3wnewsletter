**For the crypto insiders** who did [so much](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/17/politics/crypto-industry-donald-trump-reelection/index.html) to elect Donald Trump, the first week of his return to the White House went as expected. Mostly.

The big exception, which drew vocal criticism from Trump's political supporters and opponents alike, was the launch of memecoins right before Monday's inauguration. The offering effectively [put billions of dollars in the pockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdoQ8bEXmLM) of both the president and First Lady overnight.

Some notable responses, starting with a few from crypto entrepreneurs who vocally supported Trump during last year's presidential campaign:

- **Castle Island Ventures founder Nic Carter** complained to the [Washington Post](https://wapo.st/3CrsfE6) regarding the Trump memecoins: ‚ÄúI was pretty dismayed by it. It cheapens his embrace of the crypto industry.‚Äù

- **In remarks to Cryptopolitan,** [Carter added](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/crypto-execs-are-worried-about-trump-meme-coins/ar-AA1xGKXQ): ‚ÄúCall me old-fashioned, but I think presidents should focus on running the country.‚Äù

- **PointsVille founder Gabor Gurbacs** [tweeted](https://x.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1881142513018572927): "Trump needs to fire his crypto advisors, from top to bottom, and replace with people who know what they are doing. The memecoins cost the US, the presidency and his family a lot of credibility and the consequences haven‚Äôt even started."

- **Messari Crypto founder Ryan Selkis** echoed the call for Trump to [fire his crypto advisors](https://x.com/twobitidiot/status/1881106291445449215). He added: "They cost you a lot of $ and goodwill."

- **Money manager Anthony Scaramucci,** who briefly worked in the first Trump administration but didn't support him in 2024, said in [an interview with CBS News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM9jhmCBNqg&pp=ygUgY2JzIGludGVydmlldyBhbnRob255IHNjYXJhbXVjY2k%3D) that the Trump memecoins represent "a direct conflict of interests" with Trump's duties as president.

- **The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page** also [criticized](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-crypto-token-melania-securities-and-exchange-commission-8cb7abf2?st=TkFpK6&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) the memecoin launches at length. The paper says the tokens "are courting legal and political trouble."

### Week in Review: Jan. 19-25, 2025

**Trump's first week back as president** also contained some positives for crypto and the broader tech industry:

- **SEC moves:** Trump picked Mark Uyeda, a Republican member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, [to be acting chair](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trump-taps-republican-uyeda-acting-sec-chair-white-house-says-2025-01-20/) of the agency while Senate approval is pending for Paul Atkins' nomination to be permanent chair. Both are considered pro-crypto appointments, much preferable to Biden-era SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Separately, the SEC [withdrew its earlier guidance](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/01/23/sec-withdraws-controversial-crypto-tax-accounting-bulletin) that banks and other public companies should mark any customers' cryptoassets on their own balance sheets.

- **Among an early wave of executive orders** from Trump was one creating a White House working group to study implementation of pro-crypto policies, including potential creation strategic government reserve of digital assets.

- **At a White House event,** Trump promoted a joint venture among OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build new infrastructure for AI technology.

**Believe it or not,** the week also saw some notable headlines that had little or nothing whatsoever to do with U.S. politics. Thank God:

- **Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin** is taking [a more active role](https://news.google.com/read/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNYUtESjZLbmRNdS1vZnh4Z1lPWUdwclFsVngyTlZKYlc0cFk5b0lzVnBKOHJRXzZFM2hHY0JUNUZFUEZ2SHFGNGhDMVdCdDFjYmVzSk5VN0FMTDlQVWZXSWZ5MGtMRGVHWDZVTXVfaENla29VSmF1OVl2TWZZaVZXWHhqbUZZUQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) at the Ethereum Foundation amid rising concerns that the platform is losing ground to rival Solana.

- **Google upped its investment** in OpenAI rival Anthropic by $1 billion. Anthropic's total market valuation is now close to $60 billion. ([ArsTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/google-increases-investment-in-anthropic-by-another-1-billion/))

- **Wall Street banks are looking to sell up to $3 billion of debt** lingering on their books since Elon Musk's 2022 acquisition of Twitter. The deal has been one of the most financiallly disastrous for America's major investment firms since the 2008 financial crisis. But some prospective buyers have become more bullish on Twitter's debt lately. In part, their interest stems from hope that Musk's social network will benefit from his coziness with America's new president.

- **Stablecoin issuer Circle acquired Hashnote,** issuer of the world‚Äôs largest tokenized money market fund. Terms were not disclosed. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/302229/circle-scoops-worlds-largest-tokenized-money-market-fund-amid-sector-boom))

- **MicroStrategy could soon be facing** a big tax bill in the U.S. on unrealized gains in its bitcoin portfolio. ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/microstrategy-federal-income-tax-unrealized-gains-f60b2c04?st=TzSGKb&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink))

- **A big milestone to watch for:** The valuation of Ripple's XRP token, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, is nearing the stock-market capitalization of publicly traded chipmaker AMD. Wow. ([Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/26/will-xrp-ripple-soon-be-bigger-than-amd/))

- **Billionaire Frank McCourt's Project Liberty** announced it has [hired veteran crypto executive]() Sheila Warren as CEO. Project Liberty is trying to make a "people's bid" to acquire TikTok.
