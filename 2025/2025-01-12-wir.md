# Well, that was quick.
## Companies and governments are making tangible moves toward crypto as a treasury asset.

**Just before the recent Christmas holiday,** I speculated that the bitcoin-fueled growth of MicroStrategy's balance sheet, culminating in the company's recent inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, might [inspire imitators](https://w3wnews.substack.com/p/are-microstrategy-imitators-on-the).

Well, we're already seeing signs of exactly that in the early going of 2025. We've got another public company looking to buy bitcoin and (more surprising to me) several public-sector entities as well:

- **Nasdaq-listed Heritage Distilling** just announced plans to [add bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/300469/publicly-traded-distiller-launching-bitcoin-reserve) to its company treasury.  

- **North Dakota state legislators** introduced a proposal to [create a strategic reserve](https://decrypt.co/300499/north-dakota-considers-state-bitcoin-treasury) of digital assets, to divesify the state's investment portfolio. Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New Hampshire are considering similar measures.

- **One dynamic to watch:** U.S. states are required to balance their budgets, unlike the federal government, which can effectively print more dollars whenever it likes. As the New Year unfolds, perhaps those heightened financial contraints will continue to make the states more apt to adopt bitcoin before Washington does, the better to get as much bang as possible out of every public dollar. (More on the feds in a moment, though.)

- **A recently created city in southern Bhutan** said it will hold bitcoin, ether, and Binance's BNB token [in its strategic reserve](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/10/bhutan-s-crypto-reserve-could-pave-way-for-economic-growth-in-other-countries?_gl=1*1u8q1sm*_up*MQ..*_ga*ODIxNTUzODU5LjE3MzY3MDA4Mjk.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTczNjcwMDgyOC4xLjAuMTczNjcwMDgyOC4wLjAuODAxNzEzMDk3).

- **Of course, El Salvador remains the OG** of small countries creating sovereign bitcoin reserves. It recognized bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar in 2021 and has since grown its sovereign holdings to [more than 6,000 tokens](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/economy/el-salvador-s-nayib-bukele-ready-to-buy-america-s-bitcoin-at-a-discount/ar-BB1r9yMw).

**Looking ahead,** incoming U.S. President Donald Trump, who will be sworn in Jan. 20, has publicly [advocated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/12/14/trump-confirms-bitcoin-reserve-plans-15-trillion-price-boom-predicted/) that the U.S. Treasury create a bitcoin reserve as well. And in Congress, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) has previously introduced a bill to do so.

That said, based on Trump's first term, during which he wasn't exactly known for a deft command [of Capitol Hill's legislative process](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-says-he-passed-more-bills-most-presidents-n771116), I'm frankly hesistant to get too excited that Lummis's idea will actually make it into federal law this year.

It's also unclear how creating a U.S. bitcoin reserve might be prioritized against other policy items on Trump's wishlist that are ambitious, insane, or both. Sure, we could get a new federal bitcoin reserve. Or perhaps work on that idea will take a backseat to [making Canada the 51st state](https://apnews.com/article/canada-trump-us-state-131dcff58a8f56116765f160d9f35460) or [annexing Greenland](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/11/business/trump-greenland-cost.html).

Or perhaps none of the above proposals will go anywhere. Who knows?

### Week in Review: Jan. 5-11, 2025

- **Token markets have been relatively quiet to start the New Year.** Bitcoin recently traded at $95,000, up 0.9% from its 2024 close. Traders have recently fretted that a [strong December jobs report](https://www.yahoo.com/news/december-jobs-report-u-added-152805621.html) in the U.S. may signal that the Federal Reserve will be less likely to cut interest rates in the months ahead. Crypto markets have also perhaps been due for a pause after a roaring 2024. For the full year, bitcoin leaped 122%, easily beating the S&P 500's 23% gain.

- **OpenAI updates:** CEO Sam Altman says autonomous artificially intelligent agents could [enter the global workforce](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/10/ai-agents-sam-altman-workers) sometime this year. Separately, the company has begun building out its first [robotics team](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-has-begun-building-out-its-robotics-team/).

- **Meta announced** it will [end its professional fact-checking](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-hateful-conduct-policy-update-fact-check/index.html) efforts, and it updated its moderation policies, ostensibly as a way to promote free speech on its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. Critics say the moves [open the way](https://www.salon.com/2025/01/08/mark-zuckerbergs-meta-makeover-maga-grandpa-is-about-to-get-much-worse/) for more misinformation and hate speech to proliferate on those networks. Separately, Axios reports that Meta is also [eliminating](https://www.platformer.news/meta-kills-dei-program-diversity-inclusion/) its internal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs for employees, job candidates, and suppliers.  

- **The U.S. Supreme Court seems likely** to allow a federal law that could lead to a shutdown of TikTok for American users later this month to stand. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/01/10/leaning-toward-tiktok-shutdown-reports/?in_brief=true))

- **The Winklevoss brothers' Gemini Trust Company** agreed to pay a $5 million fine to settle a complaint brought by U.S. commodity regulators in connection with the exchange's plan to offer bitcoin futures in 2017.
