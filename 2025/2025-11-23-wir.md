<!--
* **Summary:** Major reports out this week indicate that financial institutions are continuing to dramatically increase their AI-related spending, driven by a fear of being left behind. Despite concerns from analysts at firms like J.P.

      * **Summary:** BlackRock's flagship spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded its largest single-day net outflow since its launch, contributing to a negative flow trend totaling nearly $2.2 billion in net redemptions for the fund over the past four weeks. This market-moving development comes amid a broader sell-off that saw Bitcoin prices briefly dip below $90,000. In a stark counter-trend, institutional spot Solana ETFs extended their streak of net inflows to 16 consecutive days, suggesting a major rotation of institutional capital into high-yield altcoin products.
