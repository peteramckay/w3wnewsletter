**We've moved from a murmur of misgivings** about whether AI is in a bubble to a roar.

<!-- Keep lead item to ~300 words!!!!!! -->

- The tech sector is experiencing a sharp decline, with AI stocks taking a hit due to concerns that the market has become overvalued. Nvidia's strong earnings call failed to convince traders that the AI bubble is sustainable, leading to a sell-off in tech stocks, including AI infrastructure companies and cryptocurrency-related stocks.

- Fortune's Brady gives good advice about the AI bubble: https://view.mail.fortune.com/?qs=449d2dd4ff9848752f05d55c916080d1266543f28e8e7dfaa9bc5a7f642d7247f312d789a1604ca10c6fc78e590efaaec47d11531b6d14eff592b45caa804a5b41494650224aa236eca2cabfb83bc8e7

- Meta Platforms is raising up to $30 billion in its largest bond offering to fund the expansion of its artificial intelligence infrastructure, amid a period of intense investments in AI that are creating significant cost pressures. The company is also investing heavily to attract and retain top AI researchers and engineers, with employee compensation costs expected to be the second-largest contributor to the increase in costs next year. https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-seeks-least-25-billion-bond-offering-bloomberg-reports-2025-10-30/

      * **Summary:** BlackRock's flagship spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded its largest single-day net outflow since its launch, contributing to a negative flow trend totaling nearly $2.2 billion in net redemptions for the fund over the past four weeks. This market-moving development comes amid a broader sell-off that saw Bitcoin prices briefly dip below $90,000. In a stark counter-trend, institutional spot Solana ETFs extended their streak of net inflows to 16 consecutive days, suggesting a major rotation of institutional capital into high-yield altcoin products.

<!--
* **Summary:** Major reports out this week indicate that financial institutions are continuing to dramatically increase their AI-related spending, driven by a fear of being left behind. Despite concerns from analysts at firms like J.P. Morgan about the long-term return on capital for the AI buildout—which they estimated would require roughly $650 billion in annual revenue—the immediate spending spree on AI infrastructure, talent, and tools is only accelerating across the financial sector and beyond.

### Week in Review: Nov. 16-22, 2025

- **Bitcoin is on track for its worst month since 2022, with a 33% decline from its all-time high, as a combination of selling pressures and negative catalysts continue to weigh on the crypto market.** The market is experiencing a wave of margin calls, with analysts warning that a break below $82,000 could confirm a bearish trend, and uncertainty around interest rate cuts is adding to the uncertainty. https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-why-is-crypto-down-btc-margin-calls-fed-2025-11

- The crypto market has taken a significant hit, with over $1 trillion in value erased since early October, as Bitcoin and other risk assets continue to plummet due to a combination of technical and macro pressures. The market remains fragile, with some analysts predicting a possible local bottom, but others warn of further declines if buyers don't step in decisively. https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-market-meltdown-erased-1-trillion-bitcoin-btc-digital-assets-2025-11

- The cryptocurrency market has taken a significant hit, with Bitcoin losing over 10% of its value in 24 hours and plummeting to its lowest levels since April. This sell-off has left the entire market reeling, sparking renewed debate about the long-term viability of cryptocurrency as an asset. https://www.axios.com/2025/11/21/bitcoin-value-price-crypto-coin-sell-off

- Tom Lee, a well-known expert at Fundstrat, believes that cryptocurrency prices can serve as a leading indicator for U.S. stock market trends. This perspective highlights the potential connections between the two often-separate markets. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/fundstrats-tom-lee-says-crypto-is-a-leading-indicator-for-us-stock-prices.html

- According to a recent report from JPMorgan, the current crypto market correction is largely driven by retail investors selling spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, with around $4 billion pulled from these investments in November. This selling behavior stands in contrast to strong equity buying, suggesting that retail investors still treat crypto and equities as separate risk assets. https://www.theblock.co/post/379840/jpmorgan-crypto-market-correction-retail-selling-bitcoin-ether-etfs

### Looking Ahead

- **Coinbase announced** it will [do a livestream](https://www.coinbase.com/events) on the company's [official Twitter/X](https://x.com/coinbase) feed Dec. 17, dubbed System Update. Between the lines, it seems likely they will be announcing some new products and/or initiatives. Event starts 2 p.m. Pacific Standard Time

- **The tech user's lifecycle:** The Washington Post reports that some desperate parents now spend [$8,000 per summer](https://wapo.st/3X9Q3mM) on phone-free "detox camps" for their kids, to mitigate the harms of excessive screen time. On the other hand, the Post also just ran a story on the [benefits of tech usage](https://wapo.st/4rd9okx) for preventing age-related "brain rot" among older users. Go figure.

- **Based on an analysis of Spotify data,** researchers from the University of Southern California say the podcasting industry exhibits gender and racial inequalities far greater than what they saw doing similar work in movies, TV, and music. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/11/nx-s1-5605983/bros-really-are-dominating-podcasting))

### Odds & Ends

- **There are now more private-equity funds** in America than McDonald's locations, according to fintech platform [iCapital](https://x.com/icapitalnetwork/status/1991264189105483828). Wow.

- **A New Jersey animal shelter** just returned Asa, a local family's housecat that had been missing for a decade, using a microchip [implanted long ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DFrwLiw-ZU). 🐱
