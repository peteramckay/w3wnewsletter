**For consumers, the best media merger is generally none at all.** Such deals always seem to lead to higher subscription fees, less diversity of ideas, and myriad other unpleasantness.

That said, [Netflix's acquisition of Warner Brothers'](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lowest-probability-outcome-netflixs-72-billion-deal-for-warner-bros-discovery-stuns-wall-street-153038741.html) movie studio and streaming businesses for $83 billion is probably about as good as it gets for the rest of us, grading on a very steep curve. The reason why is perhaps best expressed using a metaphor borrowed from a different media giant.

Realistically, at some point long ago in the bidding process that led to [Friday's deal announcement](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros), "no merger" ceased to be a viable option. Once Warner Brothers was in play as a possible acquisition target, with an army of bankers and lawyers richly incentivized to close a sale, the company was (and is) never really going to remain independent again.

To claim otherwise at this point is akin to believing Bambi lives in the forest.

Some details to watch from here:

- **The deal still needs regulatory approval.** That's no small caveat as there are [significant antitrust issues involved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYaQA9pY3lI&t=618s), some of which may be raised in litigation by rival bidders Paramount Skydance and Comcast. 

- **CNN and Warner Brothers' other cable businesses** will be spun off into a separate company if the Netflix deal goes through. That ensures the news network's independence -- for now. [Which is great](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andymeek/2025/12/06/cnn-got-snubbed-in-the-netflix-wbd-deal-why-thats-ultimately-a-good-thing/). But to be honest, I would still worry about its longer-term prospects, as CNN will now effectively be jettisoned in a pure-play cable company facing structural decline. Much better to be part of a conglomerate with some growing digital businesses to help subsidize all those foreign bureaus, producers, and make-up artists who work behind the cameras. 

- **Paramount Skydance in particular was** (and perhaps still is?) trying to buy all of the existing parent company Warner Brothers Discovery, *including CNN and its other cable assets.* The Ellison family, which controls Paramount Skydance, has very vocally supported the Trump administration politically. Until recently, that made many Wall Streeters believe Paramount Skydance stood the [best chance to win](https://nypost.com/2025/11/22/business/paramount-skydance-is-currently-winning-the-war-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery/) the bidding for Warner Brothers, as they could perhaps gain regulatory approval more easily than other suitors. But it also raised concerns among journalists that the Ellisons might look to [meddle with CNN's editorial work](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/warner-bros-discovery-takeover-paramount-skydance-larry-ellison) to make the network tilt rightward if they were to acquire it.

- **Over at the entertainment site /Film,** Ben Pearson looked into how the Netflix deal might affect Warner Brothers' DC Comics content in particular. [Pearson says](https://www.slashfilm.com/2044070/netflix-warner-bros-acquisition-dc-universe-future/) some upcoming DC movies may not get theatrical releases at all. But he thinks DC's venerable magazine business could remain surprisingly unscathed, as its continuance would help protect movie rights to characters like Batman and Superman in the future.

Which brings us to that other perennial question that must be answered regarding any proposed media merger: 

Is it good for the Justice League?

### Week in Review: Nov. 30 to Dec. 6, 2025

- **The AI battle among Silicon Valley's heavyweights escalated sharply.** In a memo to OpenAI staff, CEO Sam Altman [declared "code red"](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6?st=L6CTNp&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) about the urgent need to respond to increased competition from Google and Anthropic. In particular, Altman is concerned about users' rapid adoption of Google's Gemini 3 model, which [launched in late November](https://mashable.com/article/google-gemini-3)... Meanwhile, Meta is expected to cut its metaverse budget by [up to 30%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2025/12/04/meta-cuts-verse-325-billion-in-flux-ai-as-ai-axe-falls-on-ad-crews/) next year to shift spending toward AI.

- **Strategy, a major holder of bitcoin,** said it has created a $1.4 billion cash reserve to fund future dividend payments. The company also slashed its full-year profit projections, underscoring the problems that have plagued digital-asset treasury (DAT) companies lately. As crypto markets have swooned, the valuations of DAT companies, which are based on the token holdings on their books, have plunged as well. ([Sherwood News](https://sherwood.news/markets/strategy-announces-usd1-44-billion-us-dollar-reserve-to-avoid-participating/))

- **AI and consumer-electronics companies** are increasingly battling for access to memory chips amid a global supply shortage. Yikes. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ai-frenzy-is-driving-new-global-supply-chain-crisis-2025-12-03/?utm_source=w3w))

- **News publishers' love-hate relationship with AI continues.** The Press Gazette's Charlotte Tobitt published an [updated summary](https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/news-publisher-ai-deals-lawsuits-openai-google/) of which organizations are suing AI startups over past usage of their work as training data. But some are also signing licensing deals with the likes of Meta or OpenAI.

- **U.S. prosecutors are pushing** for a maximum 12-year prison sentence for Terra founder Do Kwon, whose crimes resulted in $40 billion in investor losses. Such hard-line enforcement has been rare recently as the Trump administration has generally sought to ease crypto regulation.

### Looking Ahead

- **Core Scientific,** a company that previously filed for bankruptcy after building a massive data center to mine bitcoin in Denton, Texas, is now pivoting to provide cloud computing capacity for AI startups. Their move is emblematic of a choice many crypto miners are weighing right now. ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2024/12/09/a-bitcoin-miner-promised-to-help-a-texas-town-it-went-bankrupt-instead-now-its-pivoting-to-ai/))

- **Stablecoins have been the primary focus** for crypto policy worldwide in 2025, according to a [new analysis by TRM Labs](https://www.trmlabs.com/reports-and-whitepapers/global-crypto-policy-review-outlook-2025-26). The analytics and compliance firm reviewed regulatory developments this year across 30 jurisdictions and found over 70% of them were advancing new rules on stablecoins.

- **An Indiana lawmaker has introduced a bill** to allow public employees to invest in digital currencies through the state's retirement and savings programs. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/351112/indiana-lawmaker-pushes-bitcoin-pensions-crypto-payment-protections))

### Odds & Ends

- **Where have all the sneakerheads gone?** A California sneaker store owner’s rant about the collapsing resale market for collectible sneakers recently went viral on social media. Some hobbyists believe the thinning trade is symptomatic of a slowdown underway in the broader U.S. economy. ([The Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/news/sneaker-store-owner-sales-down/))

- **The South Florida Water Management District** has been deploying dozens of robotic rabbits recently in an effort to control an infestation of Burmese pythons in the Everglades marshland, where they are a non-native species. The solar-powered bunny bots help lure and detect the otherwise well-camouflaged pythons so they can be removed humanely.
