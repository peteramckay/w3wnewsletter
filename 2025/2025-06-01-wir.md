**The future of stablecoins looks brighter everyday.** But the U.S. dollar's future? Not so much.

- Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, has launched its initial public offering (IPO) with a target valuation of around $6 billion.** The company plans to raise approximately $624 million by selling shares at a price range of $24 to $26 apiece, which could have significant investment implications for Coinbase, a major partner in the stablecoin's distribution.

### Looking Ahead

- Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested that Ethereum could be a viable alternative to traditional cash in the event of a cashless society failure, citing Sweden and Norway's recent decision to maintain cash reserves due to vulnerabilities in their centralized payment systems. However, experts disagree on the feasibility of Ethereum's resilience in such scenarios, with some highlighting the need for offline functionality and others pointing to the potential of stablecoins as a solution.
