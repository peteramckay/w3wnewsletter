# On-chain, the dollar looks immune to U.S. turmoil
## Stablecoin issuers are raking in yields, landing venture deals, and moving billions ‚Äî no Fed intervention required.

**The future of stablecoins looks brighter everyday.** But the U.S. dollar's future? [Not so much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT2cohNt6a4&pp=ygUQa2xlaW4gcm9nb2ZmIG55dA%3D%3D).

Let's start with the good news, all of it on the token startups' end of things:

- **Circle, issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin,** filed with U.S. regulators on Tuesday to [do an initial public offering](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/stablecoin-issuer-circle-kicks-off-its-ipo-targeting-a-nearly-6-billion-valuation.html) at the New York Stock Exchange that would value the company near $6 billion. Bloomberg News reports that asset manager BlackRock, which previously invested in Circle during its private fundraising rounds, plans to [buy additional shares](https://www.theblock.co/post/356062/blackrock-plans-to-purchase-approximately-10-of-circles-ipo-shares-bloomberg) in the IPO.

- **Axios reports that startup Atticus** is raising a venture round that could make it the [first new "unicorn"](https://www.theblock.co/post/356431/stablecoin-startup-atticus-nears-2-billion-valuation-following-raise-led-by-defense-tech-firm-ceo-report) minted among stablecoin issuers in 2025. The deal could reportedly value Atticus as high as $2 billion.

- **The average volume of business-to-business stablecoin payments** hit $3 billion per month in early 2025, [up thirtyfold](https://www.theblock.co/post/356231/b2b-stablecoin-payments-surge-to-36-billion-annual-pace-survey-finds) over the last two years, according to a new survey by Artemis, Castle Island Ventures, and Dragonfly Ventures.

- **A bill is pending in Congress** to clarify U.S. regulations for stablecoins. Both [Vice President J.D. Vance](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/vance-trump-crypto-bitcoin-stablecoin) and [Sen. Cynthia Lummis](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/us-senator-cynthia-lummis-discusses-bitcoin-reserve-stablecoin-legislation-and-market-structure-bill-at-bitcoin-2025-conference) (R-Wyo.) touted the legislation in remarks last week to the Bitcoin Las Vegas conference.

- **The biggest stablecoin by far is still Tether,** whose market capitalization trails only bitcoin and ether among all digital assets. So far in 2025, its valuation has risen 12% to $153 billion, according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/).

**Stablecoins carry that moniker** because they're pegged to some other asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Thus they can serve as a useful link between the on-chain financial world and the conventional, greenback-based version.

Companies that issue stablecoins make money primarily through interest earned on the reserve assets backing their tokens ‚Äî typically government-issued cash or short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Some issuers also charge fees to enterprise clients and fintech partners for API access, wallet services, payment processing, or other integrations. <!-- Hat tip to ChatGPT for this graf.-->

Perhaps surprisingly, though, what these companies *don't* seem to need is a resilient dollar that holds its value well against other foreign denominations. Hence stablecoin startups' ability to keep booming even as the U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of overseas currencies, has dropped nearly 9% in 2025.

Which brings us to the bad news, as I think most readers would define it.

The dollar has softened due to a mix of macroeconomic factors that is probably familiar by now: America's [on](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-is-praising-his-u-s-steel-deal-no-one-is-sure-what-it-means-a6cb15b5?st=JrQFKy&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)-and-[off](https://news.google.com/read/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQZ1hyeDBxQ2JVX0lSWklNUnlDcWZQb19VYnVsZnJJb0lhZC0zVm5MeExCS2dRYmVCOHpiemp0UDRVLXhOQlBvSzVNT0tHaXctb3RpOUd2bXBpcnZ6WktjSEIzT3pOUWZtWUNNRGZYY1kxUlEtMVU0T3AtQWJXYllNY3FKUTBNb3pjLXFmeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)-and-[on](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xgdj9kyero) trade war with the rest of the world. A [volatile Treasury market](https://www.wsj.com/finance/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-predicts-crack-in-the-bond-market-citing-u-s-fiscal-mess-9d90cb3f) that at times has shown weak demand for U.S. government debt. And a rising appetite among foreign investors in particular to [trim their portfolios' exposure](https://news.google.com/read/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1YR3g0SEhsQWtTSUp4cHFYX3duOWZfaG56Wl9jTVFPak11UG96QWR1MGhmQWdvX3NZVktFakJ4bk55aUx3c0NyNzQxRFlwNmFPanN2bjEtbmVJbGU5dGNVMVFFUQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) to America's volatile politics. <!-- Add links as warranted -->

As economist J.W. Mason recently put it, there‚Äôs now a [‚Äúmoron premium‚Äù](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/trump-truss-moron-premium/682421/) attached to markets perceived as politically dysfunctional. In that light, perhaps it‚Äôs no wonder capital is flowing into programmable dollars that can move globally at internet speed. <!-- Another handy insert from ChatGPT! -->

### Five Things: May 25-31, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **The Trump administration has been quietly expanding Palantir's federal contracting work,** raising concerns about increased surveillance of American citizens by consolidating their personal information into a single master dataset. Palantir's tech is already being adopted by at least four federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and the Health and Human Services Department. The Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration could be up next. ([New York Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQY3g5bE9MTENNcFFaVkNkTjFydTlDc1cxcVR2T09ocTBuUDlZbzJNUU04clVDUUFrRnBMSDlRSXhVMlJIT3dNb1JVMkhqUTZHVlk3NjlDVHpibzhNUzViRHFFM3JKSVl0Y2ZZUjd2M1I4bWhEX1BmX29CY3JnTVU1TldGa3dtUVU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- **AI Watch:** Chipmaker Nvidia's quarterly revenue [leapt 70%](https://news.google.com/read/CBMicEFVX3lxTFB5Q3hXNHlfbUlJbnJGRVVwTHlWck9wUTNoLUFhUy1xaXB0eEg3b1E0MjI4Tkthakp6ZHVIRkhnZDJ0NlVtTTMzTHhZeG9MVFJXMU1YM2F6M2N6QnVvT2xubXUyZTZCQ2xsWVJ2dkNDcEg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen), beating Wall Street expectations. In effect, resilient chip demand for AI applications and data centers helped Nvidia shake off headwinds from the burgeoning U.S.-China trade war... The New York Times [struck a deal](https://www.theverge.com/news/676291/new-york-times-ai-deal-amazon) with Amazon, its first licensing agreement to officially make the newspaper's content available to train AI models.

- **Search volume for crypto-related terms** like "bitcoin" has been relatively flat, suggesting a lack of interest among retail investors despite this year's surge in token prices. The trend is echoed in mobile app rankings, which recently showed Coinbase and Robinhood around 300th place in the U.S. version of Apple's App Store. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/355861/crypto-search-trends-and-app-rankings-show-tepid-engagement-despite-recent-surge))

- **But bitcoin treasury strategies continue to grow** among public and private institutions. Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social platform, is [raising $2.5 billion](https://www.theverge.com/news/674684/trump-media-bitcoin-treasury-deal) to create a corporate bitcoin reserve... GameStop announced Wednesday it has [purchased nearly $500 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-slides-another-6-investors-184202107.html) in BTC... In remarks to attendees of the Bitcoin Las Vegas conference, Britain's Reform Party leader Nigel Farage proposed several crypto-friendly policies, including creation of a bitcoin reserve [for the Bank of England](https://decrypt.co/323180/nigel-farage-slash-crypto-capital-gains-bitcoin-reserve)... El Salvador [continues to build](https://decrypt.co/322374/el-salvador-defies-imf-again-fresh-bitcoin-purchase) its sovereign bitcoin stockpile despite the International Monetary Fund's objections... And Pakistan announced plans to allocate [2,000 megawatts of electricity](https://news.google.com/read/CBMi5wFBVV95cUxPNnFmaS0zeVdZR2U0QVNuVS1QM0VOYlNrWnVKSVJZMUphYVI3UnZIR2xoYWw2dnp4eFd0bVptbFVGT1VsOFpwTnZfd2lXVVpFaTlsdV9za3BsZWx4aDh3a0VZWlFXSnVTRDBfazJjWDU2bWxuemhRLVhjRWp4cjFfN19xck1mRl9tY0pmbDFmZUxZX09pUDBVNHhiR2E5bWFEZDBJeEtkMEZReXh6dFZLWnJPRXRWclVOUW1kZ0Zsc3FVWHJvcm92cDFBaHJ3NzF6aXl5c3lyZ0lVVEk5ZzFEMzJPNzRwQms?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) to AI data centers and bitcoin mining, the proceeds from which will go into a strategic crypto reserve.

- **And on-chain experimentation remains alive and well.** A new open source project allows users to send bitcoin [without internet access](https://decrypt.co/322192/project-send-bitcoin-without-internet-access)... Uphold said it is [exploring](https://www.theblock.co/post/356434/uphold-teases-xrp-yield-and-relaunching-crypto-debit-card-in-us) ways to offer yield-bearing investments using the Ripple token... Balcony signed a five-year contract with New Jersey's Bergen County to [tokenize local property deeds](https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-jersey-county-tokenize-240-billion-property-deeds) worth up to $240 billion... Yuga Labs [sold the rights](https://decrypt.co/323189/bored-ape-maker-sells-moonbirds-gaming-startup) to its Moonbirds series of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to Orange Cap Games for an undisclosed sum.


### Market Snapshot

*A quick look at some major indicators as of Friday's market close on Wall Street. For fuller detail, including additional indexes and asset classes, see my spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11XuSerOv1DG7vFWAkwoXehOe4G4xDMm6LSNL7SAL4vA/edit?usp=sharing).*

| Indicator     | Close         |  Weekly %     |  YTD %       
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bitcoin       | $104,529.65 | -3.5% | +15.5% |
| Nasdaq 100    | 21,340.99 | +2.0% | -0.5% |
| Gold          | $3,313.10/oz | -1.3% | +27.7% |
| USD Index     | 99.44 | +0.3% | -8.6% |
| 10-yr U.S.<br> Treasury Yield | 4.416% | -0.090 | -0.064 |

### Looking Ahead

- **Vitalik Buterin sees potential opportunity for Ethereum** in recent decisions by the governments of Norway and Sweden to curtail efforts to go cashless. These stumbles confirm inherent weaknesses in centralized payment systems that could be remedied by decentralized ones, according to Buterin and other crypto advocates. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/322398/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-sweden-norway-cashless))

- **The New York Times' Ivan Penn** is wondering whether the little-known early history of electric vehicles in the U.S. might be [poised to repeat itself](https://news.google.com/read/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5Qa2tTMHdhQTJJeklzbTVBZ0xSbkhTenNsOFc5VnlpNEctNjQwVUxxR09ZNlRDUUZhUjZ3blU1d0ZwVkhUU2hoMlZlTHlod2hKYmlZb0VDSG1zQVhScE9aaUc4Ni1QQW1DRnFkOHpoamE4NWR6dVdnVGE3VTJjN0E?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). In the early 20th century, vehicles like the Baker Electric Coupe and the Riker Electric Roadster eventually lost out to Ford's famous Model T in part because the government implemented policies at the time favoring gasoline-powered cars. Now, in a possible modern-day echo of that era, Trumpist Republicans are pushing legislation that could hinder adoption of electric vehicles and favor fossil fuels.

- **Fortune's Alexa Mikhail got an inside look** at how Gates Foundation employees have begun to implement founder Bill Gates' recently announced goal to [sunset the nonprofit's operations](https://fortune.com/2025/05/28/bill-gates-foundation-200-billion-philanthropy-international-aid/?tpcc=NL_Marketing) by 2045. That means spending down his $200 billion fortune at an accelerated pace to achieve the foundation's ambitious goals for global health, including eradicating polio and malaria, and reducing deaths from tuberculosis and AIDS by 90%.

### Odds & Ends

- **A busy 48 hours:** On Friday, the New York Times reported at length about Elon Musk's escalating [drug use and paternity issues](https://news.google.com/read/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1xdl8zVkxlTEpYQXJaZml2TUFtaGlwbnBaQlUyUmlEeDNVR3NKaGtacHNhYUhObEpRLWtPd2xCTVBVaXZXUE84aVFrMnp3Umh6WGJ6UklIQkprdThfX1NhbDhrWlItZkxuMTFDZHYyUkJFdWFaSEF4ZHAzbzFIdw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) while campaigning for Donald Trump. Then Musk showed up at an Oval Office press conference with a black eye, prompting the Times to speculate in Saturday's edition about who might have [punched him in the face](https://news.google.com/read/CBMie0FVX3lxTE02b0dGZGhFaHZqNHJJWXlEWm9kbXF0dUdDU1N3eEEyTXdvazBxMUZvYzREclczN3ZPQ0J1NG8zMGZlQlBrNjNfNkFqZ095dHlRMDdWYTQxMTE2ckg2QnZNVHk1cVZLbllIc0VlbktJUTBwUk1JV3htMlllZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). Officially, Musk says he got the new shiner while horsing around with his 5-year-old son X. But the Gray Lady sure seems skeptical of that version of events. ü§®

- **Slate's Forrest Wickman spent months investigating** what he calls ["the wrongest bird in the history of cinema."](https://x.com/ForrestW/status/1921725033837129751) The critter, identified onscreen as a Pygmy Nuthatch in 2000's Charlie's Angels, was in fact [a Venezuelan Troupial](https://slate.com/culture/2025/05/birds-movies-charlies-angels-2000-pygmy-nuthatch.html).
