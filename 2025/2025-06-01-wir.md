**The future of stablecoins looks brighter everyday.** But the U.S. dollar's future? Not so much.

- Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, has launched its initial public offering (IPO) with a target valuation of around $6 billion.** The company plans to raise approximately $624 million by selling shares at a price range of $24 to $26 apiece, which could have significant investment implications for Coinbase, a major partner in the stablecoin's distribution.

### Five Things: May 25-31, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- The Trump administration has been quietly expanding Palantir's work with the government, with the company's technology being adopted by at least four federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services Department. This move has raised concerns about the potential for a master list of personal information on Americans to be compiled, giving the administration untold surveillance power and sparking debate about data privacy and security. ([New York Times](https://news.google.com/read/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQY3g5bE9MTENNcFFaVkNkTjFydTlDc1cxcVR2T09ocTBuUDlZbzJNUU04clVDUUFrRnBMSDlRSXhVMlJIT3dNb1JVMkhqUTZHVlk3NjlDVHpibzhNUzViRHFFM3JKSVl0Y2ZZUjd2M1I4bWhEX1BmX29CY3JnTVU1TldGa3dtUVU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- **AI Watch:** Nvidia earnings beat <!-- --> | The New York Times [struck a deal](https://www.theverge.com/news/676291/new-york-times-ai-deal-amazon) with Amazon, its first licensing agreement to officially make the newspaper's content available to train AI models. (Unofficially, let's be honest, its content has been scraped by a bunch of AI models already.) | China staged a humanoid boxing match between AI bots. https://decrypt.co/322195/first-humanoid-boxing-match-china | Telegram/xAI deal: https://decrypt.co/322462/toncoin-soars-amid-telegram-musk-xai-deal-1-5-billion-bond-sale-report

- Despite the recent surge in crypto prices, search volume for key terms like "memecoin" and "bitcoin" remains relatively flat, suggesting a lack of retail engagement in the current market. This trend is corroborated by app store rankings, which show Coinbase and Robinhood hovering around 300th place in the US Apple App Store, rather than climbing to the top charts typically seen during retail surges. ([The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/355861/crypto-search-trends-and-app-rankings-show-tepid-engagement-despite-recent-surge)) <!-- Draft summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B-->

- **Nevertheless, on-chain experimentation is alive and well.** New open source project allows users to send BTC without internet access: https://decrypt.co/322192/project-send-bitcoin-without-internet-access | Bergen County, NJ tokenizing 240B in real estate on Avalanche | https://www.theblock.co/post/356434/uphold-teases-xrp-yield-and-relaunching-crypto-debit-card-in-us | https://decrypt.co/323189/bored-ape-maker-sells-moonbirds-gaming-startup

- **And institutional treasury strategies continue to grow.** 21Capital has raised almost $700m. <!-- Link TK --> | Pakistan announces new national BTC reserve | El Salvador defying IMF https://decrypt.co/322374/el-salvador-defies-imf-again-fresh-bitcoin-purchase | Gamestop | World Liberty | Nigel Farage wants the UK to have an official bitcoin reserve. https://decrypt.co/323180/nigel-farage-slash-crypto-capital-gains-bitcoin-reserve

<!--

- Online trading platform eToro has added 12 new cryptocurrencies to its U.S. platform, including Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP, bringing the total number of listed assets to 15. This move comes after a settlement with the SEC and the launch of an IPO roadshow, and is seen as a renewed push by the Israel-based platform to expand its U.S. presence.

### Market Snapshot

<!-- Preliminary formatting, data in the table below for now. Update after Friday's close in NY... -->

*A quick look at some major indicators as of Friday's market close on Wall Street. For fuller detail, including additional indexes and asset classes, see my spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11XuSerOv1DG7vFWAkwoXehOe4G4xDMm6LSNL7SAL4vA/edit?usp=sharing).*

| Indicator     | Close         |  Weekly %     |  YTD %       
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bitcoin       | $104,529.65 | -3.5% | +15.5% |
| Nasdaq 100    | 21,340.99 | +2.0% | -0.5% |

| 10-yr U.S.<br> Treasury Yield | 4.416% | -0.090 | -0.064 |

### Looking Ahead

- **Vitalik Buterin sees potential opportunity for Ethereum** in recent decisions by the governments of Norway and Sweden to curtail efforts to go cashless. Their stumbles confirm inherent weaknesses in centralized payment systems that could be remedied by decentralized ones, according to Buterin and other crypto advocates. ([Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/322398/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-sweden-norway-cashless))

- **The New York Times' Ivan Penn** is wondering whether the little-known early history of electric vehicles in the U.S. might be [poised to repeat itself](https://news.google.com/read/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5Qa2tTMHdhQTJJeklzbTVBZ0xSbkhTenNsOFc5VnlpNEctNjQwVUxxR09ZNlRDUUZhUjZ3blU1d0ZwVkhUU2hoMlZlTHlod2hKYmlZb0VDSG1zQVhScE9aaUc4Ni1QQW1DRnFkOHpoamE4NWR6dVdnVGE3VTJjN0E?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). In the early 20th century, vehicles like the Baker Electric Coupe and the Riker Electric Roadster eventually lost out to Ford's famous Model T in part because the government implemented policies at the time favoring gasoline-powered cars. Now, in a possible modern-day echo of that era, Trumpist Republicans are pushing legislation that could hinder adoption of electric vehicles and favor fossil fuels.

- **Fortune's Alexa Mikhail got an inside look** at how Gates Foundation employees have begun to implement founder Bill Gates' recently announced goal to [sunset the nonprofit's operations](https://fortune.com/2025/05/28/bill-gates-foundation-200-billion-philanthropy-international-aid/?tpcc=NL_Marketing) by 2045. That means spending down his $200 billion fortune at an accelerated pace to achieve the foundation's ambitious goals for global health, including eradicating polio and malaria, and reducing deaths from tuberculosis and AIDS by 90%.

### Odds & Ends

- **A busy 48 hours:** On Friday, the New York Times reported at length about Elon Musk's escalating [drug use and paternity issues](https://news.google.com/read/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1xdl8zVkxlTEpYQXJaZml2TUFtaGlwbnBaQlUyUmlEeDNVR3NKaGtacHNhYUhObEpRLWtPd2xCTVBVaXZXUE84aVFrMnp3Umh6WGJ6UklIQkprdThfX1NhbDhrWlItZkxuMTFDZHYyUkJFdWFaSEF4ZHAzbzFIdw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen) while campaigning for Donald Trump. Then Musk showed up at an Oval Office press conference with a black eye, prompting the Times to speculate in Saturday's edition about who might have [punched him in the face](https://news.google.com/read/CBMie0FVX3lxTE02b0dGZGhFaHZqNHJJWXlEWm9kbXF0dUdDU1N3eEEyTXdvazBxMUZvYzREclczN3ZPQ0J1NG8zMGZlQlBrNjNfNkFqZ095dHlRMDdWYTQxMTE2ckg2QnZNVHk1cVZLbllIc0VlbktJUTBwUk1JV3htMlllZw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). Officially, Musk says he got the new shiner while horsing around with his 5-year-old son X. But I think it's pretty clear the Gray Lady is skeptical. ðŸ¤¨

- **Slate's Forrest Wickman spent months investigating** what he calls ["the wrongest bird in the history of cinema."](https://x.com/ForrestW/status/1921725033837129751) The critter, identified onscreen as a Pygmy Nuthatch in 2000's Charlie's Angels, was in fact [a Venezuelan Troupial](https://slate.com/culture/2025/05/birds-movies-charlies-angels-2000-pygmy-nuthatch.html).
