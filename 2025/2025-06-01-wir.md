**Stablecoins are hot,** believe it or not.

<!--

Some early possibilities:

- AIGADGETS: Followup to last week's post about OpenAI/Ive digital companion in the works. Consumer appetite for AI is kinda spotty, the blockbuster ChatGPT launch notwithstanding. This wasn't the case with the iPod or iPhone. Wrap in data, previous attempts at "third devices," smart speakers, watches, metaverse, etc.

- STABLECOINS: Yeah, they sound boring. But they're becoming really important. Could be a good quick hit.

- BADLOOK: Trump's self-dealing in memecoins and DeFi, as well as his potential wrecking of the broader U.S. economy, could taint the crypto industry as a whole for a long time.

- TRISTATE: Wrench attack, Adams bitcoin bond, NJ tokenizing 240B in real Estate.

- IMF: Their predictions of doom in El Salvador never came to pass.

### Five Things: May 25-31, 2025

*The week's top headlines about emerging technologies and trends reshaping the web:*

- **IPO mania is spreading in crypto world.** Circle, the issuer of the popular USDC stablecoin, has launched its initial public offering (IPO) with a target valuation of around $6 billion.** The company plans to raise approximately $624 million by selling shares at a price range of $24 to $26 apiece, which could have significant investment implications for Coinbase, a major partner in the stablecoin's distribution. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/stablecoin-issuer-circle-kicks-off-its-ipo-targeting-a-nearly-6-billion-valuation.html)) | Online trading platform eToro has added 12 new cryptocurrencies to its U.S. platform, including Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP, bringing the total number of listed assets to 15. This move comes after a settlement with the SEC and the launch of an IPO roadshow, and is seen as a renewed push by the Israel-based platform to expand its U.S. presence.

### Looking Ahead

- Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested that Ethereum could be a viable alternative to traditional cash in the event of a cashless society failure, citing Sweden and Norway's recent decision to maintain cash reserves due to vulnerabilities in their centralized payment systems. However, experts disagree on the feasibility of Ethereum's resilience in such scenarios, with some highlighting the need for offline functionality and others pointing to the potential of stablecoins as a solution.
