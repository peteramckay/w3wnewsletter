- **Nasdaq has filed a rule change with the SEC** to allow tokenized versions of listed stocks and ETFs to trade on the same order book as their traditional counterparts, potentially bringing blockchain-based settlement to the national market system. The proposal aims to balance tokenization with investor protections, setting a higher bar for equivalence to the underlying stock and addressing concerns about overseas platforms that market tokenized U.S. equities without conferring shareholder rights.

- OpenAI is facing growing opposition from California's regulators and philanthropic groups over its plan to restructure as a for-profit company, with concerns that the move could violate the state's charitable trust law and prioritize profits over its mission to create AI for the public benefit. The company's leaders are discussing a last-ditch option of relocating out of California if regulators complicate the transition, but OpenAI has stated it has no plans to leave the state.

- AlterEgo, a Boston startup, has unveiled a wearable device that enables users to communicate silently with computers by detecting faint neuromuscular signals in the face and throat when a person internally verbalizes words. This non-invasive AI interface, described as a "near-telepathic" interface, has the potential to revolutionize how people interact with artificial intelligence systems and connected devices without the need for keyboards, touchscreens, or spoken voice.

### Looking Ahead

- **Gen Z is embracing the uncertainty** of an AI-driven job market with humor and adaptability, but experts warn that this lighthearted approach may mask a deeper need for preparation and strategic thinking. To stay ahead, educators, employers, and policymakers are being urged to embed AI literacy into curricula and foster a culture of proactive adaptability, rather than simply reacting to change. ([Fortune](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/gen-z-laughing-face-ai-123000930.html)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B --> | **Stanford computer science professor Jure Leskovec** is turning to traditional paper exams for his 400-student classes, citing the need to test students' knowledge and critical thinking skills in the age of AI. Leskovec's approach highlights the challenges of implementing AI in education and the growing demand for human skills, particularly domain expertise, in the workforce. ([Fortune](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/stanford-computer-science-professor-went-093500264.html)) <!-- Draft news summary by Leo/Llama 3.1 8B -->

- Google's AI Mode, a new search tool that provides real-time AI-generated answers, has gained significant traction with over 100 million monthly active users in the US and India, and is expected to become the default search experience for Google. However, the shift to AI Mode raises concerns about the impact on the web economy, with some experts warning that it could lead to a decline in traffic for publishers who rely on traditional Google search results.

- NYT Douthat/Bannon intvu. Why do Bannon and Andreessen agree about feds wanting a consolidated tech sector? ([]()) <!-- Link TK -->

- Research is raising concerns that the increasing reliance on AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT could lead to a decline in the creation of new knowledge, as humans may lose incentive to contribute to and participate in knowledge-sharing platforms like Stack Overflow and Wikipedia. This could have far-reaching consequences, including a "dumber" web and a decrease in critical thinking skills, as humans become reliant on AI for answers and lose the ability to engage in novel and creative thinking.
