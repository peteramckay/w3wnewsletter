**The tragic death of activist and podcaster Charlie Kirk** is the most online political assassination in U.S. history.

That adjective . "very online"

Kirk built his following online, through podcasting and social networks. And the young people who went to hear him speak in person no doubt found him online.

People who still get their news from traditional sources like could be forgiven for having no clue who he was until he burst into the news TKTKTK.

The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protects lies, hate speech, and nonsense.** Count me among the people who think that's ultimately a *good* thing, ugly though such stuff is to encounter in day-to-day life, as it ultimately helps protect more socially beneficial forms of expression as well.

However, that doesn't mean lies, hate speech, and nonsense should be anyone's business model.

The company's leaders are discussing a last-ditch option of relocating out of California if regulators complicate the transition, but OpenAI has stated it has no plans to leave the state.

### Looking Ahead

- **Mashable's Matt Binder explored** the possibility that Google might soon [replace its venerable search interface](https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-mode-search-default-rumors) at google.com with the company's AI Mode feature. Such a change could have serious implications for the broader internet, including traffic referrals to site publishers.

- **My former Wall Street Journal colleague Greg Ip** is worried that popular AI apps' incessant remixing of existing knowledge might lead in the long term to [fewer real breakthroughs](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/will-ai-choke-off-the-supply-of-knowledge-8a71cbcd?st=y4TZtZ&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink) that produce new knowledge. For example, there are already signs of declining human contributions to knowledge-sharing sites like StackOverflow and Wikipedia. Hmmm...

- **Fortune just published** a couple of good reads about how AI is  transforming American higher education, by firsthand witnesses. Bentley University lecturer Jeff LeBlanc says his students are facing the prospect of a post-graduation job market upended by AI with "[a blend of pragmatism and fatalism](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/gen-z-laughing-face-ai-123000930.html) that feels uniquely Gen Z." Meanwhile, Stanford computer science professor Jure Leskovec says he turned to [traditional in-person paper exams](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/gen-z-laughing-face-ai-123000930.html) for his 400-student classes two years ago to counter AI-fueled shortcuts on take-home assignments. Perhaps even more surprising: The students requested the change.

### Odds & Ends

- **Astronomers at Arizona State University** now believe that Oumuamua, a mysterious interstellar object that passed into our solar system in 2017, was a giant sheet of nitrogen ice. They say it may have broken off from a Pluto-like exoplanet. ([Space.com](https://www.space.com/astronomy/dwarf-planets/1st-known-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua-is-an-exo-pluto-a-completely-new-class-of-object-scientists-say))

- **The startup Alef Aeronautics** has begun testing flying cars at two San Francisco Bay Area airports. ([KTVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1x87FS-xtE))
