- Robinhood added to S&P 500, but Strategy is snubbed. ([]()) <!-- Links TK -->

- Linea launch ([]()) <!-- Links TK -->

- **Nasdaq has filed a rule change with the SEC** to allow tokenized versions of listed stocks and ETFs to trade on the same order book as their traditional counterparts, potentially bringing blockchain-based settlement to the national market system. The proposal aims to balance tokenization with investor protections, setting a higher bar for equivalence to the underlying stock and addressing concerns about overseas platforms that market tokenized U.S. equities without conferring shareholder rights.

- **CoinShares**, a European crypto asset manager, is set to go public in the US via a $1.2 billion SPAC merger with Nasdaq-listed Vine Hill, positioning it as one of the largest publicly traded digital asset managers globally. This move is expected to fuel CoinShares' international expansion and enable US investors to participate in its global growth, with the firm aiming to capitalize on stronger valuations and a favorable regulatory environment.

### Looking Ahead

- **Gen Z is embracing the uncertainty** of an AI-driven job market with humor and adaptability, but experts warn that this lighthearted approach may mask a deeper need for preparation and strategic thinking. To stay ahead, educators, employers, and policymakers are being urged to embed AI literacy into curricula and foster a culture of proactive adaptability, rather than simply reacting to change.
