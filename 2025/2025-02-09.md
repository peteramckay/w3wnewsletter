# America's states are racing Washington to adopt crypto.
## In capitols from Phoenix to Harrisburg, lawmakers are exploring creation of digital reserves.

**Twenty-one American states** have now either adopted or formally considered various forms of public investment in crypto, according to [Bitcoin Reserve Monitor](https://bitcoinreservemonitor.com/), a new site tracking such proposals.

In particular, a race is heating up to see who will become the first to create a strategic crypto reserve. North Dakota has already [rejected the idea](https://bitcoinreservemonitor.com/usa/north-dakota). But such proposals are still pending in more than a dozen other state legislatures, with Maryland and Kentucky [joining the fray](https://decrypt.co/305098/kentucky-maryland-latest-states-bitcoin-reserve) last week.

**Why it matters:** Strategic crypto reserves could help states manage pension obligations and other financial challenges. Meanwhile, any buying by such deep-pocketed entities to build new reserves from scratch could bolster the broader token market, creating a boon for private-sector investors.

The state-level bills in the U.S. have garnered less press fanfare than possibile creation of a [federal strategic bitcoin reserve](https://www.lummis.senate.gov/press-releases/lummis-introduces-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-legislation/) -- an idea floated by Republicans in Washington. But they could ultimately prove more fruitful.

Three factors that may make the states more apt than Washington to adopt crypto in 2025:

- **Constitutional/Political Dynamics:** The U.S. Constitution clearly stipulates that Congress is [responsible for all spending](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i/clauses/756). That should inevitably affect the federal government's ability to build and maintain a strategic crypto reserve, regardless of President Trump's stated support for the industry. If even a few members of Congress disagree, especially in the fractious House of Representatives, a national crypto reserve could quickly die on the vine.

- **Monetary Policy:** Washington already holds (and frequently uses) the power to print more of its own dollars to cover its expenses. The states can't do this. Hence they have greater economic incentives to get creative and, perhaps, adopt alternative stores of value like crypto.

- **Fiscal Requirements:** States have to balance their budgets; Washington famously doesn't. Hence any windfall from a gain like bitcoin's 122% price jump in 2024, for example, would be felt more tangibly at the state level than it would in Washington. So would any steep losses in the future, of course. But for now, as long as crypto remains in a bull market -- and continues to beat traditional investment yardsticks like the S&P 500 in particular -- the sector should continue to pique the states' curiosity.

**Political junkies might also take note** of the bipartisanship of the states' recent crypto push. A quick cross-referencing of [Bitcoin Reserve Monitor](https://bitcoinreservemonitor.com/) and the election data site [270toWin](https://www.270towin.com/) shows that 14 states that have considered investment in digital assets so far are "red states" that were forecast to go for Trump ahead of November's presidential election. But five were Harris-leaning "blue states," and two (Pennsylvania and Arizona) were considered presidential swing states.

Also intriguing: The crypto-curious cohort includes Iowa and New Hampshire -- two states famous for their early presidential primaries.

Is it too early to start speculating about the '28 race?

### Week in Review: Feb. 2-8, 2025

- **Elon Musk's efforts** to figuratively [bulldoze](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/musk-federal-government.html) multiple federal agencies, [gain access](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-elon-musk-doge-treasury-5e26cc80fcb766981cea56afd57ae759) to troves of American citizens' personal information, and re-hire [an openly racist geek](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93q625y04wo) who resigned during what appears to have been a fleeting bout of common sense dominated coverage of America's national politics last week. These antics also invited formal challenges in [Congress](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/02/new-oregon-member-of-congress-introduces-43-word-stop-musk-act-as-her-1st-bill.html) and [in court](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/08/g-s1-47350/states-sue-to-stop-doge-accessing-personal-data). Yet Musk still had only the second-highest disapproval rating (49%) out of 18 public figures assessed in a new [Economist/YouGov poll](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econtoplines_c1AfT3R.pdf). Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg somehow fared even worse at 56% disapproval among poll respondents.

- **Yikes.** Google updated its ethics guidelines for AI to remove commitments not to apply such tech to weapons or surveillance. ([Washington Post](https://news.google.com/read/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPTTJsT0kza2tOM3lsb1paaGJzdkdpbGRXdFhlLThfZzFjcTNPaFVsNGRONXYtbi1yekp0VzlCckVUZHAwcTVDUEllTFM5d0Q3VGxwX3pfVGpRczFMVVRJa3ZUS2RKbUIxbWE5UWtuOXZFUjI5cVBEOUVRc0pXaDJxUF9HRGpnc3ZEMUNuN0VR?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen))

- **A head-scratching remark from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman:** In a recent [AMA session](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ieonxv/ama_with_openais_sam_altman_mark_chen_kevin_weil/?rdt=56101) with Reddit users, Altman acknowledged that the recent launch of rival DeepSeek highlights how his company has been ["on the wrong side of history"](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/sam-altman-believes-openai-has-been-on-the-wrong-side-of-history-concerning-open-source/) when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. He and his lieutenants say they may release code under open licenses more liberally going forward.

- **It's enough to make you wonder** why OpenAI ever put "open" in its name to begin with, no? It's almost as if "open" was always a misnomer for a company that is in fact more focused on building proprietary stuff -- the opposite of open source. One might even get the impression this was always a naked attempt to monopolize AI as a product much as search and social were monopolized in earlier eras. Hmmm...

- **As part of a deal to secure a $1.4 billion loan** from the International Monetary Fund, El Salvador amended its pro-bitcoin law. El Salvador still officially considers the token to be legal tender, but it eliminated many of the practical elements that designation generally carries around the world. Under the amended law, El Salvador no longer considers bitcoin to be "currency," its adoption by merchants is optional, and the state will no longer accept bitcoin as payment for taxes and debts.

- **Trivago unveiled a partnership with Travala,** a Singapore-based travel site that accepts crypto payments. ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/04/trivago-adds-travala-s-hotel-inventory-gaining-crypto-payment-options))

### Odds & Ends

- **Police are investigating the theft of a 100,000 eggs** from a tractor-trailer in Pennsylvania. On the black market, they could fetch $40,000 thanks to a burgeoning egg shortage propeled by a bird flu outbreak in the U.S. ([Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/eggs-stolen-pennsylvania-100000-c1c260ca05b9f84612c61071cb504939))

- **The chances of an asteroid hitting Earth** in 2032 just went up slightly. But don't worry. They're still "only" a little more than 2%. ([Salon](https://www.salon.com/2025/02/08/the-odds-of-an-asteroid-hitting-earth-in-2032-just-went-slightly-up/))
